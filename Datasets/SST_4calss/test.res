rating:2 the father is paternally played with a very sweet charm , by veteran actor , seymour cassel . this is an original and quirky story , but it also follows a long tradition of films that took similar routes ( ferris bueller's day off , the graduate ) , so what seems to be taking place and in what direction it is going and who max is , cannot be simply or absolutely stated , which is great in some ways but completely mind-blowing in other ways , as this somewhat cheesy story has more holes in it than swiss cheese , yet no matter how it seems to be served , it always seems to be a story that is tastefully done . max is not exactly a nerd , as he is pushy , being neither completely likable nor obnoxious , who propels himself into the rushmore scene by pursuing extra-curricular activities to such a degree that it reaches the point of absurdity , as he is involved in so many diverse activities , that it is a wonder he has time to even take off the preppy jacket he loves to wear around the campus . it is at rushmore where he is bursting with untold energy for adventure , entrepenureship , and romance . there are many twists to come into play as the story is disarmingly told , forcing us not too get too comfortable in what we expect to be a sane commentary of the going-ons here . these scenes were wickedly cruel to comprehend , as the story flipped over from comedy to psychological drama , and to a certain extent , a temporary suspension of belief . yet it was this facet of the story that was most novel and daring about the film , as it let the characters freely play out who they were without contrivance . therefore , even if you didn't particularly care about the way things were going , you were at least taken aback by seeing how everyone interacted with each other . blume retaliating by smashing the kid's bike . the young director's previous film , bottle rocket , was also written by him with owen wilson , it was also quirky but a bit less professionally done . both films show promise of better things to come . there are still patches to this story that need further developing and to be pruned along the edges before we can say we have things in order , but after saying that , i must say that this is still a first-rate film , with a lot of bite to it , depicting characters in a discrete way that allows them to be very real and formidable . this is bill murray's best role yet , and for newcomer , jason schwartzman , the son of actress talia shire , a role made for him in filmdom heaven .
rating:1 small time crooks is a small time comedy , nourished by getting a fast start off the gate with some pretty familiar comedy routines -- it starts off paying homage to the italian film " big deal on madonna street , " but it is not able to sustain that homage or carry on with the fast-paced comedy hi-jinks after the first half hour , and what's worst , it falls into a predictable way of telling the story , which ends the film on a rather pedestrian note . this film had the look of something made in a film factory , without an edge to the routine comedy sequences . but to its credit . . . it had a lot of laughs in it . he seems to have given up being an artistic filmmaker ( i doubt if he ever was committed to being one , but he did like ingmar bergman's " wild strawberries , " and at one time attempted to make bergman-quality films ) . he's certainly no risk taker in this film , knowing his audience and giving them what they want might as well be his motto . he is banking on the audience cravings for a few of his patented one-liners to give them a comedy fix until his next predictable work . here's where this sweet and silly story plunges off the comedy map , as it tries to show how tracy now wants to grow as a person and join the highbrows and get some culture , but she can't because she still remains a vulgar person inside despite her new outward trappings . the running gag here is how cheap their taste is in their furnishings , decorations , clothes , and vocabulary , before and after becoming rich . this results in a fluff film , with a twisted message about money not being important to the couple , which seems like an out of the place message , since money is all the couple talks about and seem to care about as a means for their happiness . but this is a film that will only succeed if it can make you laugh and the message wrongly or rightly perceived might as well have not been sent . there are just enough woody sight gags and one-liners to make this film keep its head above water . . . for example , one gag goes like this : " hey , did you hear the one about that polish car pool that met at their workplace ! ! ! "
rating:1 a big , loopy , overlong , dullish docudrama-style thriller , about the losing battle of the 'war on drugs . ' it is at times more preachy than dramatic , taking the point of view that something has to be done about the drug situation but not saying what , only that what's been tried has not worked and the youth of america are being unduly harmed by drugs . there's nothing new presented here : same old answers , same old film , but this one takes itself more serious because of the talented cast and the formulaic way this story was adapted from a simon moore work , which was scripted by stephen gaghan and directed with precision but in an uninspiring way by steven soderbergh . it first ran as a mini-series on british tv in 1989 , a medium it probably would be the most logical place to view this updated ambitious version . once all the stories are in place , the film shows how human frailty plays a part in the corruption of various individuals . manolo succumbs to being bribed by the drug lords as he is overwhelmed by the money he sees passing hands and does something he would never have done , if not tempted . the film wraps up neatly , tieing up all the tragic ongoing drug war stories . so he asks out loud , how can you wage a war against your own family ? the film soft pedals any advocacy for legalizing drugs and offers no hard-hitting critique of current policies , except to say it doesn't work . it seems to have safely placed itself in the middle of the argument , not taking sides ( a rather wishy-washy way to leave things ) . i don't know what could be said , other than this was a competently made film , the actors were forceful in their roles , with the plucky performance by the conflicted cop benicio del toro outshining the others , and for some comic relief , there was some amusing dialogue between cheadle and guzman . the film had a nice look to it , as cinematographer soderbergh aka peter andrews , has given the film a look of urgency , using a handheld camera , and working with different tinctures of desertlike yellow-orange shades and icy blue lighting to get a better view of his subjects and their hard-boiled tale .
rating:0 a vigorously played aip submarine b-film , with a no-name cast and low-budget special effects . all the enlisted men talk in an unnatural jargon , which is make-believe navy talk , that is sometimes irritating on the ol' cranium and at other times slightly amusing to the proletarian in me . this is basically a harmless ww11 war film that is watchable for insomniacs turning the tv dials late at night in search of something benign . it is one of those rare 1950s ww11 films where the japs are not even cursed out -- the men could have been fighting the greeks and no one would have known the difference . one of those 'gung ho' movies , where the only dissension comes from one of the officers who goes over-the-top in being too gung ho . i recommend this film for those who didn't like " the yellow submarine " but like any other submarine film which doesn't have a cast of rock singers . this is one of those films that has a simple plot and pads it with supposedly human interest stories , as it highlights one character from among the officers and one from the enlisted men . halsey's acting efforts nearly sabotaged the film , as his strained performance was just blah ! the film's purpose was to build tension for its action-packed climax , but by having an inferior complex because of the thinness of the story and the characters all being dullards , an effort was made instead to show how courageous the captain was and how he was , predictably , able to win the men over to his side .
rating:2 jimi hendrix was too stoned to adequately perform " foxy lady . " the obnoxious announcer , rikki farr , goes so far as calling the crowd " pigs , " wavering back and forth between conjoling and chiding them , with neither strategy doing anything but creating more bad feelings . the crowd shots showed rampant hashish smoke and psychedelic drugs being ingested , nudity , the potential for a riot , and talk among the concert goers that this was a just a " money " thing , as the feelings of idealism or another woodstock , which was only one year earlier , seemed like ancient history . the director of this film had to wait 25 years after the concert to release the movie , as the promoters went belly-up over the concert . what is suprisingly good is the sound of the film and the high quality of the music . this film was no woodstock , but it had a charm of its own , and is certainly worth seeing not only for the music but for the history of the period . the moody blues sang a great rendition of " white satin . "
rating:0 a rather mild comedy/mystery , filmed in b&w , featuring the bumbling comic antics of jack lemon and the ravishing beauty of kim novak . under richard quine's laborious direction , the film plods along until it perks up for its surprising ending , which is a takeoff on those slapstick silent comedies . the film failed to catch my interest even though the actors seemed to be giving an all out effort to make this turkey have legs . the main problem lies in the ridiculous script . his part was so wooden , you could have thrown it into the fireplace for kindling wood . the hilarious moments come , as lemon bumbles around while courting the mysterious kim . its offbeat comedy just didn't resonate with me . i found the production too dry and hardly on par with those buster keaton vehicles it tried to emulate and the mystery story was too lame-brain an effort to cause any fuss over . this one's watchable only for those fans of kim or lemon . i do not count myself as being one of those fans .
rating:3 the film critic , jonathan rosenbaum , has written a great review on the merits of jacques demy and his film , the umbrellas of cherbourg , going on to compare demy to the great japanese film director , yasujiro ozu . that both men achieved excellent success in their films by portraying the human condition through the eyes of normal lifestyles is , indeed , a curious oddity . umbrellas is made into an opera-like film by composer michel legrand . the actors sing their lines rather than just say them . the film itself is lushly colored in pastels , offering a very brilliant color-coordinated production . this story doesn't seem to be much on paper , but it is as poignant , as surely as it is ordinary . it is one that happens most of the time , rather than the reverse being true , of people marrying for love . and that is demy's point , that coincidences , luck , and good timing seem to matter even more than love . everything about this film was done to perfection . demy is one of the most underrated directors of french cinema . american audiences rarely get a chance to see his great body of films , and that is surely their loss .
rating:1 the film takes us into territory film's rarely traverse . it crosses the emotional boundaries of a forbidden love . timing , which is a key to all romances blooming , is just right here . on the island , we see them kiss and are not made aware if anything more intimate took place . the film asks the question about what makes us love someone . mom's ideal is hardly less childish which is the point varda is making , the ideal mate sought is all about one's feelings and they are irrational . this is a suggestive film , touching a tabu subject , but it handles it delicately with an unflinching directness . this affair is viewed with the same frankness varda thinks we should view all things in life . the current aids epidemic must be faced with humor and real knowledge , or else ignorance about it will cause more damage than good . this film did not exploit an exploitive situation , and it provided much fuel for thought .
rating:2 this worked , making for a crafty production , mainly because it left much of the horror scenes to the viewer's imagination . hammer studio also exploited the x rating it received , which meant only those over 18 could attend , as it launched a massive ad campaign which brought in the crowds to find out why such a rating and also by making the x part of the film's title--the quatermass xperiment , it kept the public's attention on its ad campaign . yet the monster remains a sympathetic figure . it was an easy film to watch , as it had its creative moments in the dark . it offered better entertainment value than most big-budget sci-fi films .
rating:2 this film offers a literate script and is sensitively directed , it's a brilliant debut as a director for playwright kenneth lonergan ( co-scripted " analyze this ! " ) . besides writing the screenplay and directing it , he also has a minor part in the film as a religious counselor . it is so well-conceived a work that it never feels stagy , as many other films of this type tend to be . the film was a co-winner of this year's sundance grand jury prize and recipient of the waldo salt screenwriting award . the siblings have different personalities and have gone down different roads , and even though there is a strong bond between them , what this restaurant meeting highlights is how different they also are , as this scene brilliantly sets the tense tone for the remainder of the film . the sheer beauty in the film is in the natural bonding that develops between the curiously bright but lonely rudy and the irresponsible terry . the bad decisions terry makes are not selfish ones , but are the one's he makes because he means well but doesn't always know how to do the right thing . sammy and rudy touch something about themselves in terry's short summertime visit , something they wouldn't have touched that was so real without terry being there as a catalyst for change . this subtle drama is satisfying in almost every respect , but mainly as a realistic presentation of working-class characters who are struggling with the mundane problems of everyday existence . this is a superbly acted and subtle work , whose only flaws are in the unbelievable romance between boss and worker and the artificial lovemaking depicted between sammy and her townie boyfriend , both of which had no ring of truth to it . but , otherwise , this is one of the best films of 2000 , and indie type of art film with an intensity and a strong sense of realistic dramatics that brings out the complex emotional problems of the main characters .
rating:2 for ms . deepa mehta -- fire is the first film of her trilogy on the elements , this her second , and water , to be filmed later , will be her third . they believe they can be invisible , spreading sweetness to the land like sugar placed in the middle of a glass of milk . the problem with the film is twofold ; one , is that all these tragic events are translated through the childish eyes of lenny , who cannot grasp everything that is happening , she just doesn't have the maturity to do that . because of that , the story has too much of a childish flavor to it and is simplified to a point that touches on being too fine . it was an unneeded artifice , that tended to spoil the flow of the film's dramatics . the other problem , with this otherwise splendid history lesson and tragic love story , is that all the movie's metaphors are used as if they were merely to amplify the historical tale . the character's lives were reduced in scope and they seemed to be milked for the benefit of making the story fit into the historical text . it is stunningly photographed , using reds and purples to express the blood-curdling scenes of lahore under siege and a glowing yellow for the warm household scenes and a brownish amber to catch the vast beauty of the countryside . it is noteworthy for exploring in detail the destruction of innocence and the arbitrary splitting up of the earth , and how everyone gets caught up in the emotional frenzy of hatred and how difficult it is to just do what is right . there was a certain power the film had , that could not be denied . nandita das as shanta , is the heart of the picture . her performance was very moving and gave life to this epic film . his masterful performance , changing from an endearing and helpful figure , to one who embraces violence , was what put a human face of evil on this melodrama and saved the film from being thought of as mostly a metaphorical historical exercise .
rating:3 winstanley is a truly amazing and painstaking account of misery , as it depicts those whose cause is righteous and nonviolent . the narrative is taken from the pamphlet writings of gerrard winstanley , a gentle , christian radical . he sort of resembles a hippie of the 1970s . the film is based on the book by david caute , " comrade jacob , " but has been thoroughly reworked by co-directors brownlow and mollo . his unique filming style , his penchant for austerity , his demand for authenticity , his equalizing of all scenes in importance so that no event sticks out from the others , and his inspired devotion toward looking at the past , perhaps hoping to unearth some missing piece in the puzzle of mankind that keeps the modern world from advancing on the past tragedies , gives this film an air of adventure . lacking the necessary dramatics of films that are more accessible to the general public , this film is nonetheless a work of great intrigue and visual beauty . despite being filmed without the benefit of professional actors , the only professional being jerome willis who played general fairfax , this film has a certain solemnity about it that forces its truths to be seen in the face of the actors . it is brownlow's way of filming such misery , a way that records the diggers' sufferings as if it were the official record of what happened , and probably could pass for what is official . this sense of reality is what gives the film its raw power . it's a lesson in history that is re-created from the words of a journal that allows the directors to look back at the past with a sense of reverence . this film acts as a vehicle to understand what the diggers believed and how they lived , and how they justly thought that the earth was made common property for everyone . that everyone born on earth shall be fed by it and that all are equals in the creation . his performance was beautiful . there is no question , this low budget project , the bfi put up seventeen thousand pounds , achieved the maximum in having an authentic look , even showing the rare breeds of animals , of the time . it showed breeds of pigs and chickens that don't exist today but did during the 17th century . the film's cost is about the same as a james bond film's title scene would cost . the film's cinematographer , ernest vincze , like almost everyone in the film , including the directors , worked for nothing . it doesn't pretend to have the answers , but the questions it raises about the ability of mankind to live and work together , is one worth asking . the message of the film might seem naive or confrontational to many , including the marxists , the bourgeoisie , the film critics looking for a more recognizable kind of film to evaluate , and the common man , bored by what he doesn't want to know . but to others , perhaps the more restless in society , not afraid of ideas , there is a freshness in this work that you can't easily shrug off by pointing to the filmmaker's refusal to be more melodramatic . the scenes were acted with conviction and its lack of hollywood type of poshness actually played to its favor , making the action seem more pertinent . their story is not something you can easily forget in the black-and- white framed shots , taken by a hand-held camera , and in their uncompromising idealism squaring off against self-righteous forces that wanted to crush them , afraid of their new visions for mankind . try comparing winstanley to other period films of the commercial variety , and it is hard not to see how much more real and meaningful this film is . if nothing else , at least , it is a hard film to forget . for the poetic dream of winstanley , for an equitable and more reasonable world , one that is not forged by malice and greed : that is a vision the world is still waiting to see actually happen . this film is available on video by milestone .
rating:2 apple , the ( sib ) ( director : samira makhmalbaf ; screenwriter : mohsen makhmalbaf ; cinematographer : ebrahim ghafouri/mohamad ahmadi ; editor : mohsen makhmalbaf ; cast : massoumeh naderi , zahra naderi , ghorbanali naderi , azizeh mohamadi ; runtime : 85 ; 1998-iran/france ) it is based on a true event and uses the actual family involved in relating this odd but wonderful story , which is told in a wryly humorous manner . this ignorance is bliss tale , a tale with no given solution , seems like it is a documentary , but instead it mixes fact and fiction , as it adds setup fictional pieces to its factual story ; and , this national story in iran , which was widely reported in their media causing a national scandal , plays here with a dazzling sense of wonderment and complexity . it makes a potent statement about women's rights in a country where women are seen as inferior , and it also symbolically calls for more freedom for all people .
rating:3 goldfish , for the iranian celebrants , are symbols of life . what is truly amazing about this masterly done film , is how gracefully it uses real time to take you into the countdown for the new year , that is marked off by repeated radio reminders . by this time , we are sucked into accepting the importance the money and goldfish has for the girl , it is not unlike our christmas time desire to please our children with gifts , whether or not the gifts are worth it or not , they have an intrinsic value above their real worth , and we feel so happy when we see the joy in their eyes when they receive their gifts . the brilliance of the film , is that the story that unfolds is about the little girl's adventure with the shop owners and the strangers in the street she is not supposed to talk to but does , and how caught up in it we get because it is so human a story ; it is something that is universally understood , that we forget that we are talking about iran , the country that we demonized , our arch enemy ; and , if the film can be criticized , it is for glossing over any of the numerous wrongs in their society that could be criticized but are not . though , i think , that might be unfair to say , since the movie should be judged for its own sake and not for any outside political reasons . this is a great final shot of the white balloon in the air , that is not contrived or pretentious , but is genuinely a heartfelt and memorable moment of the film , topping off a very human film , that might surprise a lot of people that it was made in modern iran . the white balloon is a masterpiece in its simplicity , and the way its tale of the human condition is so easily related without demeaning the people involved ; and , how childhood is explored , pointing out how a child tries to grow up when faced with adversity , are unmatched in most hollywood films . if i had to compare it to any film that i have seen , i think of de sica's the bicycle thief and see some of the same values about life in both films . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net
rating:3 a precious and unnerving thriller , one that never fails to offer some kind of hitchcockian surprise , as the film is unpredictable throughout . but harry is troubled by this and refuses to release the tapes to anyone but the director . this somber thriller is a beauty , projecting a maddening character study , and infiltrating a secretive and cold world , where the protagonist , a private wire-tapper , has lost his sense of direction , knowing that one's privacy can so easily be exposed by expert technicians like himself and be used for any purpose . the acting was magnificent on all parts , the story was grippingly told , and its denouement , is the equal of the best thrillers ever made . a unique film , whose great sound track by walter murch , is essential to the plot , as the technology in the film was the key element in setting-up the very eerie atmosphere and bleakness associated with a technology used so despairingly . the film is even more relevant today than it was back in the 1970s , as the world has become even more so of a place where it is possible for technology to invade the privacy of any citizen .
rating:2 poetry is the vehicle of choice for how the story is best transcribed onscreen , since dialogue is almost non-existent . it is told as if time doesn't exist , one event runs into another and everything seems jumbled . images of water and fire are used throughout the film for purposes of symbolically cleansing the soul and destroying the impurities in it . paint is used as a contrast to blood . in a film loaded with contrasts , the huge gap between most of the population which is poor , is harshly contrasted with those who have money to burn . innocence is being corrupted by the experienced , proving that nothing remains pure in this city that steals one's life , one's poetry , and one's spirit . which signifies that there is something despairing about the foreign influence in vietnam , but what that despair exactly means , is never clearly stated in the context of the story . he somehow keeps her a virgin by having her do all the kinky sex tricks that do not involve touching , like peeing for a customer . this film is a visual masterpiece , capturing the frenetic pace of life in the city and the faces of sorrow on the poor ; it paints an unsentimental picture of a place that is a living hell . but it is not a masterpiece storywise , as its storyline was rambling , laying no specific blame for what is happening on the local government or for that matter , on anyone , only implying how rotten the western influence is . also , it seemed to me , there were too many violent scenes , as the filmmaker seems to revel in them without expounding on them . this powerful film offers westerners a potent dosage of what life is like in a third world country , a country most americans only envision in a depersonalized way , but the film still had too many gaps in its storytelling and too many loose ends it left not fully developed . cyclo , as a person , should have been more flesh-and-blood like , rather than used as merely a morbid symbolic example of the loss of innocence . there was something there that just seemed to be elusive about the film , the director just wouldn't let the viewer get into without imposing his own personal barriers ; he doesn't even want to give us their real names , as if he thought , we would sully their hardships even more than it already is . he mainly wants to shock our sensibilities , to have us look plaintively at his native country like he does , even if he too is only a tourist . there is nothing wrong with that in itself , but his social designs could have been painted with clearer brush strokes . the contrast between those who are gentle and those who are brutal , and those who are dreamers and those who can't dream anymore , could have been better utilized than to point out the obvious , of how wretched a place this is and of how the gentle ( innocent ) have little chance of succeeding . still , this is one powerful film , filled with relentless and disturbing visualizations , whose poetic voice comes from the inside of the director and is strong and boiling over with metaphorical emotion . cyclo was a deserved winner of a golden lion award for best film at the venice film festival .
rating:3 writer/director john sayles weaves an intriguing story that is both a mystery and a study about the relationship between the generations and the races . this is a slow moving , superbly acted , thoughtful , provocative look at america's past and where it is now , as seen through the past lives of the main characters depicted in the three ethnic communities . the laconic tone of the film and the strong intellect in the script bring so many other things to the table , that the mystery , even though it is followed through and wrapped up , is not quite as important as all the other issues it brings up . the subtle message being that the past must be remembered but it is more important that the future must not be blurred by what already happened and can't be changed . this ambitious project is an engrossing and an original work . there are no predictable and formulaic messages , this is one of the great films of the 1990s , one that is done with wit and tact . everything about it rings with truth , even if it has to break down a few legends to get its point across -- proving that often enough , legends are not all they are cracked up to be .
rating:0 a far-fetched and schmaltzy hollywood-style mainstream tale about time travel . to buy into this half-baked sci-fi wannabe , one has to have a suspension of disbelief and of all rational thought . if the catch-the-killer subplot had any real suspense to it , i might have bit more for this nonsense storyline . but that thriller part doesn't even hold up with your average tv detective show . but this story is unfortunately overtaken by its weak serial killer story . thereby , the film is reduced to overreaching its credibility by confusingly switching back and forth between past and future events , sloppily changing one for the other , until nothing made sense , since you have to keep changing both simultaneously to alter both dimensions and the film fails to accomplish that storyline with accurate details . the acting was surprisingly good , despite the poor script . dennis quaid is a throwback father -- one that many a child would gladly appreciate . if the film did one thing right , it showed a family that was really together and good to see on the screen , especially with all the recent films mostly showing only dysfunctional families . it was refreshing to see one for a change with a father as a good role model , even if some might find this relationship too corny . gregory hoblit ( primal fear/fallen ) has fallen into the trap of going overboard in his use of sentimentality , which overtakes the film and makes it too gooey for comfort . also , his directing suffers from an inability to tell a good detective story , even if his idea on time travel is intriguing . unfortunately , the time travel story does not hold up to any intelligent scrutiny . so what is left , is a movie that should find its own audience with those who find the father/son relationship meaningful and find the time travel concept to be entertaining .
rating:2 this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff's play " hospitality suite . ''its their dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical , following in the long tradition of salesmen films from -- death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross . this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high . in this case , it appears to be in landing the big kahuna . what makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product . he criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burnt-out . larry and phil can't fathom how bob didn't make a sales pitch . these three performers were outstanding , each understanding what their role called for , each coming through with a marvelous performance . the only problem with the film , is that it's more of a play than a cinematic experience . but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics , give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see .
rating:2 the story unfolds like a routine charlie chan mystery , except the plot is well-executed . a solid action episode , featuring a chase through the paris sewers .
rating:0 in this kidpic , which is a very safe movie to make in today's iran , as even with the intolerant dictator khomeini dead , and a more liberal regime in its place , there is still no room for anything but subtle dissension to get sneaked into the story , because of strict censorship , and the most fertile ground to do that sneaking in , is in a type of film like this one , where there is no challenge to the ongoing political system and its fundamentalist religious system , as everything is seen through the children's eyes . the only thing , is that i couldn't pick up any subtle attacks against the regime . maybe it was too subtle for me to pick up , or maybe there was no dissensions , this was just meant to be a tear jerker of a film . the story is guileless . it is about a lost pair of shoes and a shared pair of sneakers , which if it was an american film and didn't give me a chance to see a country such as iran , which i am unfamiliar with , but curious to see how it looks under this new regime , i would have been really disappointed at how weakly structured it was . but because it is iran and i am aware how difficult it is to make a film under censorship there , i am more tolerant of its flaws than i ordinarily would be . why he doesn't tell his teacher about this problem , i don't understand , especially since his teacher seemed like a kind man , and , since this might be a problem that is not that uncommon in a school where a lot of the children are poor . but , then again , if he did that , that might have taken away the reason for making this slight film , in the first place . if this film was made in the states , its theme could be , the ny state lottery theme , " you gotta be in it to win it . " during the race , the filmmaker pulls out a bagful of cinematography tricks and borrowed shots from other directors to make the race an exciting one , but a race that left me unimpressed with what kind of point the filmmaker was making . if one , could summarize , how this feel good iranian version of that old hollywood standard formula works here , tugging at the audiences' heartstrings every chance it can get , as quickly as tears fall from ali's wide oval eyes and a frown covers zahra , as whenever bad news comes her way , which is most of the time , we see a frown appear on her . i assume , what the film is trying to say , is see how you must solve your problems on your own , don't blame it on the government . i guess the point being made here is , both girls can be generous and have learned how to live with their poverty . the father's poverty reflects the director's own background , which is why the family is so touchingly portrayed but in such a manipulative manner , that it fails to be as convincing a portrayal as it could have been , if done in a more free flowing form . the father is seen as a true believer , never questioning authority , deeming everything to be in the hands of god , whereas his religious beliefs are so strong , he would not even take a piece of sugar that he is chopping up for the mosque to have for his tea . this display of moral rectitude , reveals how simple things can be if you just have faith and perseverance to endure life's hardships . is this what the film is really trying to say ? but as an impactful film , it falls on its face with a thud , unable to make heaven seem to be a real place for children , where everything that is bitter is shown to be really fine despite what appears to be not so fine : rich people are not bad they can be nice , schools are not that rigid they can be accomodating , religion is unquestioned but that is because it is necessary , being poor can make you sad but it is not the worst thing in the world , and obedience is sometimes difficult to understand but it can be rewarding .
rating:1 zhang yang's bittersweet dramatic comedy , " shower , " is meant to be a crowd pleaser . its manipulative and sugary story is set in modern beijing . why he didn't phone is a mystery to me , since he doesn't seem to go anywhere without his cell phone . the film's more serious message , is of the family's estranged relationship . the director zhang yang has created a graceful , masculine film ( all the main characters are male and the story is told from their view ) , avoiding for the most part the sentimentality that could have sunk the film , if handled by a lesser director . this mainstream , middle-brow , foreign film was the winner of audience awards at festivals at rotterdam and all over europe and asia , which means it clicked with varous audiences because of its universal appeal . though , i thought , to make his point about the old and new china , he pulled out too many old contrived tricks out of the hat , from the bathhouse being torn down and replaced by a shopping mall , to a retarded brother stealing the film with his comical and good-natured appeal . yet what i found to be outright fascinating , was the strong relationship between the wonderfully benevolent zhu xu ( the king of masks ) , an actor who has a certain magical screen presence , and the gifted actor who played his retarded son , jiang wu , and the equally gifted actor pu cun xin who as the older son , was used by the director to signify how well the transition was going in china from the old to the new . but what interested me most about shower , is that it gave me a chance to observe everyday life in a country that has been closed to the west , and the film has done it in a most endearing way . other than that , i still found the story too sweet for my taste .
rating:3 he has come up with a possible masterpiece , arguably his best film , that overcomes a questionable b-movie plot , to achieve an elegant , memorable , and poetic story . he leaves for work at the sound of the eerie throbbing of the jungle drums , which is only announcing that the sugar syrup is ready to be poured . it is interesting to note , how this 1940s film had a tolerant and respectful attitude to blacks , and even allowed them to be critical of upper-class whites without being rebuffed for it . but the treatment doesn't work . one of the all time greatest scenes in horror movie lore takes place , as betsy takes the sleepwalking jessica through the thick jungle of the sugar cane fields while the howling wind and rustling branches and sound of a conch is being blown to bring to the ceremony the faithful . the ritual voodoo ceremony is done in a deliberate and quietly dignified manner , with the result being hypnotic . the obscure motives of the mother and the nurse , and to who was at fault in paul's marriage , and what role wesley plays in all this , is never cleared up completely by the film but that only makes the story more intriguing . jessica's personality is seen differently through the eyes of others , but since she was a zombie for the whole film , we have no idea what her role was in this indelicate affair . the seemingly innocent betsy , seems clever enough to have thought of a solution to this problem that could benefit her . the natives want the case of the zombie settled , they feel there is enough sadness on the island , as is . the power of the script , is in the telling of a tale about local superstition built around the moral dilemma of what is the christian concept of right and wrong , and by creating an unforgettable and haunting atmosphere that blows away the less than sterling acting by the male leads and the unlikeliehood of the story being totally believable . tourneau's direction for this low-budget film was marvelous , and it was spectacularly shot by roy hunt in its chiaroscuro imagery , bringing to light a film that is both incredible and magical .
rating:1 edward dmytryk was a victim of the hollywood blacklist , here he returns after a few years in exile to make a stanley kramer produced message drama shot in a realistic style . the film makes good use of the san francisco streets to tell its serial-killer psycho story . the film's message was not that well received , but the suspense of tracking down the nondescript psycho had a good touch to it . the film was a blend of film noir and social drama , pointing out the urban problems of alienation and the public's indifference to those who are mentally unbalanced .
rating:1 it is a biopic that is brutally honest about the exiled writer as an opponent of castro's , one that lets us see that liberation to him was not only a matter of politics but of the freedom to be a homosexual and an artist , something which the castro regime couldn't agree with and came down harshly on both homosexuals and artists , by sending them to prison camps . his happiest moments in childhood seemed to be watching the nude men bathing and those moments connected with nature , such as his love for the landscape and the ocean . spanish actor javier bardem portrays arenas ( someone he closely resembles ) with great sexuality , perception and feeling , giving a virtuoso performance . castro will allow for no artistic freedom or homosexual activity , which he labels counterrevolutionary . julian schnabel has created an emotionally penetrating look at a man living with his alienation in a marginalized existence and using that bitter experience as a source of energy for his writing . this beautifully photographed film , which looks much like a series of paintings on canvas , might be too bleak for a general audience , but it paints a more realistic political view of castro's cuba than most of the recent films i have seen about this subject , and should be of special interests to those of all persuasions who care about freedom and the arts .
rating:0 i'm not an admirer of philip kaufman's ( the unbearable lightness of being ) previous films . in quills he has adapted doug wright's play to create a drab period piece of the marquis de sade story . it lacks an edginess , as the shocks against civilization's sensibility are not geared to move the intellect . its theme embellished the belief that freedom is in writing without censorship . the film's rallying cry could be , 'bring me a quill ! ' it was a time of mixed messages in the areas of social reform and repression . kaufman shot this dreary tale at pinewood studios and used mostly an english cast , though some cast members were australian and american . in this version , the marquis de sade is made out to be more of a misguided writer and a witty aristocrat than truly a murderous villain . there are many quotes from his writings , but not those that show him in his more beastly nature . royer-collard is reduced to be more the villain than the marquis is . he has the most solid role in the film and makes the best of it . kate winslet didn't convince me she was a peasant laundress , but she still came off with a feisty although a forgettable performance . the film failed because it was too dull to be entertaining and it didn't have anything startling to say about a startling subject to be intellectual . its shrill moments outweighed its moments of irony , when it was able to show how insane the men of reason were in their treatment of the mentally ill . this was a middlebrow work , that made light of the innovative marquis as a man who was merely politically incorrect rather than completely debased . aiming at those targets is like shooting at ducks in a pond .
rating:1 it did ruin the film to a certain extent , as it looked disjointed in parts and did not appear up to fuller's usually high standards of filmmaking . nevertheless , it resulted in a disturbing film about american morality that has something to say about hypocrisy and something modern to say about being an independent woman . the couple talk about byron's poetry and about venice being a special place for lovers , and everything seems too good to be true . for towers , the naked kiss is that of a pervert . for fuller , this film is a morality story , where honesty can't seem to exist within the law but only outside of it . the weakness in the film , is that it asks you to believe its flighty story without questioning it . but its moral premise is on solid footing .
rating:2 talented mr . " the talented mr . ripley " offers another screen adaptation of the patricia highsmith novel , the first being rene clement's " purple noon ( 59 ) , " a more straight- forward hitchcock type of film that the french actor alain delon couldn't do much with . anthony minghella ( the english patient ) will make the theme of the film into an identity crises problem that ripley has and allow the film to become a character study about a sociopath who can complacently say about himself , " i always thought it would be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody . " he has removed most of the complicated psychological layers of the character and made ripley into a seemingly nicer sort of person , the murder he commits is not premeditated as in the novel but comes about when he is provoked beyond what his fragile nature can take . minghella paints a picturesque view of how these rich americans in the late 1950s live as ugly americans in europe , as the photography is brilliant , with its array of luminous colors , from mediterranean places such as san remo , palermo , roma , and venice . the beautiful scenery , villas , luxurious hotels , and splendid boat rides are just right for getting the audience all excited about taking a look at how the smart-set travel and spend their leisure time . this fits in nicely with the touristy look of the film . but the story , as engrossing as it is , can so easily be forgotten when the film ends . this is a big budget miramax film , not an arthouse personal film . its magnificent look took away any kind of noir intent the novel might have had if the film was done in the pure form it was written in . the film becomes primarily a character study about ripley and not a film that is too concerned about filling all the holes it has in its plot , which are enough to sink a ship . she just seems to be along for the ride- her part is a rather inconsequential one , though it is in the same vein as the tiresome parts she usually stars in , but here we are , at least , spared from seeing tears come down her reddened cheeks . we just see her justifiable petulant anger , as she gives ripley that knowing bitchy look of disapproval , indicating i know what you did to my dickie . ripley's main intent , will be to concentrate on absorbing himself in dickie's personality and to try to ingratiate himself with the womanizing and capricious wastrel- a part that jude does a good job of conveying , as he captures the character's nasty mood swings as well as his goofy flippant side . the scenes with freddie pushed the envelope wide-open and made the average intelligence that ripley possessed diminish in his chilling presence . hoffman's screen presence sparked keen interest in the story and made it seem more powerful when he was onscreen . when he wasn't onscreen , the story wasn't quite as fascinating , which made me wonder if he would have been even more suited to play ripley than the bland damon was . and , even if , there seems to be little sympathy for the idle-rich during ripley's spree , there also becomes less and less sympathy for the psychopathic ripley , who the filmmaker was insidiously trying to get the viewer to identify with . thereby , the film loses touch with the character who falls too far from the graces of any rationality for social acceptance , who is seen drowning in his own lies and trapped in his own guilt-ridden nature . in the novel , ripley is more of a long-range scheming sociopath than he is in the film . the new spontaneous twists in the film changes the mood of the story , and makes it more creepy but not more endearing . i think the reason for that , is because the matt damon part loses the character's rich rebellious flavor and makes him become less an antihero than viewed as a serial murderer . to fully identify with ripley would require the viewer losing himself totally in the character and seeing the world only through ripley's narcissistic eyes , and that is the way minghella probably wanted one to see the film and understand how ripley operated . the problem with that , is it simplified all the dark notions of ripley's character and lightened the burden of the story too much , trying to make it conform with the '90s style of film . as a result , this seductive film comes to a conclusion that failed to live up to the gamesmanship offered throughout most of the story . the film became less meaningful the longer it went on , and it ran for 139- minutes .
rating:1 guy ritchie has cleaned up some of the mess he made in this encore to his surprise box-office cult hit " lock , stock and two smoking barrels , " but has made the same kind of empty , semiserious/comedy/crime caper , with many of the same actors from that film . but , this time the story holds together better and is much more amusing , thanks in a large part to the ensemble cast who come and go in the film with seamless fluidity . it's a film filled with an assortment of colorful runyonesque characters from the underworld of crime , or illegal bare-knuckle boxing matches , or from the outcasts of society . this film , like the director's other one , has no strong role for a woman . the main plot is about a series of mishaps over a stolen diamond that somehow brings together a varied mix of characters who are after it or are inadvertently drawn into its disappearance , but the plot is really irrelevant , it plays as a mcguffin--this is strictly a character driven film , with all the characters being either lively in a cartoonish way , undeveloped , or forgettable . the movie will spin-off in different directions , telling each groups' story , until it all comes together in the last reel and plays itself out . the film is played mostly for the comedy and it throws everything it thinks is crazy into the comic mix , even a shaggy dog story . the language used has many expletives and is often hard to understand because of the heavy accents . the violence is brutal but cartoonish , as the film is styled much like a comic book . the rest of this heavily induced homage to musical video films , has a soundtrack that ranges from massive attack to oasis . ford's menacing psychotic performance , stood out as the film's most memorable one . pitt's self-effacing comedy was the performance i best enjoyed , as it gave the film a sparkling light touch ; while , dennis farina , also , was pleasingly comical and added some light touches to this cartoonish film . the only slow down in the film is in the opening moments , when the large cast of characters is introduced . other than that , the film moves at high speed , with all kinds of film gimmicks , from jump cuts to multi use of graphics . this is a film that thrives on controlled chaos as its signature theme . i would call it another dumb cult picture the director has made , one that suffers because there is no one in this film to care about .
rating:1 a mindless action film that exploits the current news headlines while it presents andy warhol's dictum that , in the future , everybody will be famous for 15 minutes , and adds to that its ludicrous plot revolving around how everyone is enchanted by fame , either wanting to be a celebrity or to gawk at them . it also presents an annoyingly didactic message about violence encouraged by the media for ratings and of criminals getting away with murder because they know how to bend the rules , as its maddening story only worsens with an incoherent finale . there is nothing subtle about this heavy-handed thriller . the good part of the film is its fast-paced street action scenes and the attention grabbing psychopathic villain ( karel roden ) challenging the self-absorbed celebrity ace homicide detective ( de niro ) , which makes for vulgar entertainment . it's a film that has about 15 minutes of fervor to it before it gets grounded into a mixture of sleaze , violence , and heartless melodrama . emil will at one point declare : " i love america ! the only good thing about this arrangement , is that despite its seamly nature , eddie is a dedicated and good cop , and the show does help in catching criminals . other than the action scenes brilliantly filmed by jean yves escoffier , the movie is unappealing . as for the actors : de niro is playing a part he always does very well , showing off his comical gift for quirkiness and endowing his character with a larger than life presentation . burns is his opposite , a bland personality , who doesn't watch tv or seek publicity , and the performance succeeds only in being a bland one , intentional or not . the juiciest part is reserved for roden , who makes the most out of being a scary figure , a sociopath with an unintentionally droll wit . he could be any one of a number of tabloid tv slimy hosts , reminding me most of the ass kissing geraldo rivera . there's not much to this flick , except for the beautiful way its mayhem was filmed . its cynical opinion of the media seemed hypocritical , since this film is just as exploitive and violent as the tabloid tv show it was railing against for the whole two hours of this film .
rating:2 so it is with rohmer , who in actuality might not be such an exacting realist as first thought , but more of an artist who happens to be a realist , perhaps in the mode of a monet , whose artistic work is appreciated because his water lilies mean more to him and should to us than just the flowers they are . this is a very ordinary love story between middle-aged lonely people who are unable to make a connection with someone else , even though they are people who have a lot to give and are far from being losers . for rohmer , being moral is simply living as simply as one would : being natural . being a french film , it is very chatty . it also takes a long time to develop as it makes sure that we understand all the people involved and what kind of philosophy about life they have , before we come to the crux of the story . how the people speak and how they react to the ordinary things in life , is really what rohmer is interested in . it is what gives this film its flavor and distinguishes its director from others of the french new wave , of which he is a part of . to watch a rohmer film like he intended it to be observed , is to take in the magnificence of the natural , whether it is the opening of the film when we are introduced to the town's older white buildings , as the light falls against them and contrasts its whiteness with its black shadows or if we view the verdant fall colors of the countryside and its sense of a cultivated peace as the sun shines on it . this sense of beauty has stood the test of time and is worth savoring . but her matchmaking doesn't work because there is no chemistry them . what is most endearing about the film , even if it is a bourgeois tale , is that it has a french charm to it and a deep-seated respect for all the people involved . that the amorous professor and the playful and impulsive rosine and the dull leo are shown in equal terms with the industrious magali and the elegant isabelle and the sincere salesman g ? rald , which is a sly way of telling the story in a non-judgmental way . there's much to recommend in this film that feels right and touches a sore subject that should interest mostly those in their forties and later years of life ; what the story lacks is a great deal of imagination and a something more substantial in it to make the modest story have something more to say than it does . the film only goes so far in being realistic before it has to resort to farcical contrivances to keep our interests . but even if it is not always interesting , it does keep us on our toes rooting for the nice winemaker to come up with something more than a bumper crop . this was rohmer's fourth and final film about the seasonal cycle , and it might be the best one , letting in the most sunlight and being very pleasurable to watch , highlighted by fine acting by all concerned . by the time the film ends , we have the feeling that we really know these individuals , it is as if we met them in real life and they have become our acquaintances .
rating:2 refn moves the pusher along with an inward existential beat to it and outwardly we hear the loud pulsating electric music of heavy-metal . the film has a sharp-edged look by using available light- shot so that the handheld camera jitters- just like the unflappable antihero does in his guts . there are some chilling scenes thrown in , that are not shocking , but represent the matter-of-fact violence that is taking place . whether frank lives or not , becomes less important than in seeing what a hell he has made for himself , desperately trying anything he can , to outhustle his way out of this mess he is in . the only thing that stops this film from being better than it is , is that frank has proven himself to be a worthless human being , and the film doesn't take us into his inner being , giving him any hope if he should somehow survive the mess he's in , he would be a better person for it . so , ultimately , it is difficult to care that much about what happens to frank . the director has cooked up a very disturbing film , that is derivative of pulp fiction ( the conversation frank and tonny have over the difference between renting a video and going out to a movie could be right out of pulp ) . but , this is not a bad effort for someone who never went to film school .
rating:1 a rather flat film noir that never gets that interesting . it's the simpleness of this tale and lack of any pretensions that makes it convincing but not necessarily sparkling .
rating:2 of all things made into a film , calligraphy is one subject that few movies have used as their subject , but greenaway , true to his reputation as a filmmaker with an outrageous streak in him to live up to , continues to make outlandish films that have a certain perversity to them , as well as show an elegance in clever filmmaking . pillow book is an individual's diary of observations and a presentment of an interesting list of things the diarist has jotted down , such as duck eggs and a silver bowl filled with shaved ice . the plot turns surprising simple , as revenge becomes the motive for nagiko , and this offbeat film will remain interesting mostly through its striking visualizations . the stunning visualizations range from ones of comedy to ones of sensuality to ones of gross cruely . her sensuality is seen in most of the books she writes , but seems special when she is with jerome , as frontal nudity is there , to be examined from all different angles by a technically efficient camera , that handles these nude scenes as casually as if the actors were fully dressed . the fun in the film is in the silliness of the story's subject matter as juxtaposed against the solemnity of the books being written on skin , with either somber religious chants or the same pop tune being played over and over in the background . she is really the only one in the film that we see developing and the only one whom we come to understand what she is trying to do . there seems to be a determined effort to be witty , even if the humor is not scaled to what the story is saying . the result of this work is a film that is startling to behold , with gorgeous photogenic shots , superimpositions , amazing computer graphics , a splash of intriguing gold and red color patterns , with everything ending up so perverse and lost in an intimacy that seems so melodramatic that even the scenes that do mean something to the characters still seem to be too absurd to really mean much . but the film did have plenty of fire to it , hatred , passion , jealousy , and mystery . i just didn't find that the story was that emotionally engaging to win me over completely to what i was seeing , even if i found the film had much to show for its effort . but for those who like to see the unusual and something that is artistic , this film is both unique and unforgettable : it's pure greenaway .
rating:2 bruce robinson , the creative director and writer of " withnail and i , " has come up once again with an original film , which again stars richard e . grant . " how to get ahead in advertising " is a tirade against the phony world of advertising and the screams denouncing that industry seemed like sweet music to my ears up to a point , as the message of the film eventually moved from being funny to becoming shrill and overwhelming , even to someone like me who was sympathetic to the script . ad men could very well be the lowest souls on the food chain on planet earth , is a point that doesn't have to be nailed into me before i get it . the point being made , is that both the business world and the world of science are ready to sell almost any product to make a buck , as they both exist by giving the public what they want . this is a film that rants on throughout , as it starts off very funny and then moves into sermonizing about the corrupt industry . the huckster's motto being : if you want to sell pimple cream , you have to encourage people to have pimples . the cast play their parts with the earnest intensity and gullibility required , with richard grant showing a lot of energy and a tremendous ability to verbalize . it's an unusual picture , one worth a look at for those who don't mind pure nuttiness instead of dramatics and tension in a story . it sounds far-reaching , a ghastly cry against the excesses of materialism , or does it ?
rating:1 there's not much in the way of thrills or surprises in this minor noir film , one that is able to combine a story about diamond smugglers and a smallpox outbreak in the new york city of 1947 . it is mildly diverting because of its able depiction of america's cold war paranoia during the early 1950s against anything foreign , as the film shows how an entire city can become terror stricken by something unknown attacking it . to make sure that you know that he is the heavy in the story , he will speak with a foreign accent . everything foreign in this film is either connected with something sick or with something dangerous to america . the action part of the melodramatic story was weakly told , while the noir characterizations of sheila did capture the desperate feelings of the subject , but it was not enough to overcome the overall inability of the story to have a heart to it . the mechanical acting by everyone , except for keyes , and the unconvincing action scenes made the film appear as the b film it was , despite the great noir camerawork of joseph biroc , who caught how dark the city could be for someone on-the-run .
rating:1 this is the first film to go from a super-16 original to hdtv and then to a 35mm negative . it was shown at the 1998 toronto film festival . jay anania's second feature is a very cold , intellectual film that asks the question : can we have a memory of what we only imagined ? this is a mystery puzzler without much emotional impact or much of a payoff . it's imitative in its minimalist style of a robert bresson film . it was intent on saying something , but you would have to be a mind reader to know what it wanted to say . though , she still is not certain if what she envisions is a dream or a memory . to go along with the somber and ridiculously serious tone of the movie , there are moody vocals by judy kuhn . the film's cinematic style is eye-catching and seems to be what the film was all about , but the acting and the story itself felt forced .
rating:1 there was no visible difference between the characterization of a sleek photography magazine , frame , that is the subject of the film , and the film itself , with all its glib characters provoking an air of chic fashion , all in the pretense of art . it is a performance that makes the film seem greater than how it really is . the complications that arise out of this new relationship is the springboard for the plot . the two of them seem to have a chemistry together and their kissing scenes did give us a needed look into their passions , with the more controlling lucy being in charge of things and instigating the relationship to be more sexual . she has most of the lines in the film that pack a wallop . the combo of the three women with different intentions and personalities , plays well , as the acting here is really fine . all the actors were properly ensconced in their roles and supported each other very well . eventually the film , after being carried along by sheedy's intense performance , dies an ungraceful death from too much of its slickness ; it ran out of things to resolve other than by means of contrivance , and it was highly questionable that the " art " seen was really worthy of being deemed as something special . we just lost interest in the characters , the film began to look like a commercial for a magazine that wouldn't stop and get to the main article . so what could have been cutting edge dramatics , if the lesbian romance was followed through further , turns out to be a film not about art , but more of a soap opera story , about how three women , at different stages of their life , get together and separate . all the pain that is there , is finally settled in the usual way sitcoms settle problems they don't want to handle any more . which left the film only somewhat satisfying ; it did create a proper atmosphere for us to view these lost characters , and it did have something to say about how their lives are being emotionally torn apart . but we only get a voyeurs look at them , and that is not enough of a look for us to say that we penetrated into their world of mind-games and drug induced delusions and need for each other . the film just looked too much like the slick magazine it presented in the film ; that it wanted to say something more about syd's sudden sexual reversal and about the despair in lucy's life , but it just couldn't get it out what it wanted to say , which is why the film became a let down . its style was , perhaps , too beautiful for its own good . it would have been wiser to develop more depth for the main characters and show them to be more than the superficial beings they seemed to be on screen . being a talented photographer is not necessarily being a fully developed person , as evidenced by lucy's dissolute lifestyle and poor decision making .
rating:3 the country itself was a bit paranoid during this tense period of the cold war . as technology used in the wrong way was no laughing matter , a nuclear war was a strong possibility . that this film is able to exploit that craziness of attitudes prevailing and make a stinging satirical comedy out of it , a film that is not pass ? , even as of today , in 1999 , after 35 years , speaks volumes for its satirical power . the nature of the film is irreverence for those who are involved in building up this nuclear conflict . a theme of inhumanity kubrick kept intact throughout his film career , even in his last film , eyes wide shut . . . this is one of the greatest political satires , if not the greatest ever made . a not to be missed film .
rating:0 it's possible for peter greeaway ( " drowning by numbers " / " a zed and two noughts " /``prospero's books'' ) to make a more boring sexual/erotic fantasy film , one that is more didactic and analytical , but not likely that he could duplicate one that is also so full of itself as this one was . it is the director's audacious opinion that he can get away without having a story to go with the full frontal nudity display of men and women he flaunts throughout the film . it results in a torturous viewing experience , as pablum is spouted in verbose spurts of emotive stagy responses , while the reward for the viewer is a few stilted visual delights and a few restrained chuckles to be had at the absurdity of all the perversity . the film defies social conventions and commercial filmmaking sensibilities , something greenaway has built a reputation on , as his films are critic-proof , playing to art-house audience types who relish his deft camerawork and the cerebral challenges his films pose as puzzlers . if so , what a left-handed honor is bestown on fellini ! the father's response to the film is , " how many film directors make films to satisfy their sexual fantasies ? " the son says -- " most of them . " which is about the best way of explaining what this very personal film means for greenaway . the film didn't mean much to me , but it did say something about how women understand sex better than men and men are such children when it comes to sex . it brought up things that are taboo and showed how art is a metaphor for one's obsessions in sex . the film felt so much like attending a tedious college lecture in a fellini 101 course in perversity as expounded by the arid professor greenaway , that it turned into an anti-erotic movie , a text book type of film where you can bring in all sorts of intellectual things that weren't developed in the film , but were only hinted at , and thereby there will always be something perceived about the film to justify it as an erstwhile effort .
rating:3 a wonderful film . mike leigh's valentine to the theater . this 160-minute musical epic ( just right in length--the film was never dull for a second ) , moves at its own very satisfying speed , enhanced by the magnificent musical arrangements of carl davis and replete with many hilarious episodes ( it's a very funny film ) . it also has an opulent cinematography by dick pope , the eye-pleasing stagework of gary yershon , the just right costumes by lindy hemming and the impeccable performances by all concerned , with special kudos to jim broadbent as the constantly sulking and cranky librettist william schwenk gilbert . leigh makes this into a story about what happens backstage : capturing the arduous process of creating a gilbert and sullivan show from scratch , accurately depicting the petulance of the actors , the reality of the business side of show business , those dreaded rehearsals , and all the delicate balancing of egos that come into play , as the director pushes for the performances he wants . it couldn't be more real or more tempered with total affection for what the actor and writer must go through to get what they want out of their work . it is as good a story about the backstage happenings as any in films , and is so much superior than shakespeare in love , which basically did the same thing last year and was rewarded with an oscar . it was amazingly well done to watch his facial and bodily transformation from one of a grouch to unmitigated joy in an instant , as his love for his work is written all over him . as " the mikado " goes into rehearsal , gilbert forcefully directs the play and the actors are just as brilliantly daunting whether rehearsing or cavorting backstage , or performing for an audience . one of leigh's pet themes over the years , is for actors to do improvisations . his meaty part couldn't be played to greater perfection , in a performance that is memorable , making it difficult not to think of broadbent whenever the name gilbert will now be mentioned . topsy-turvy captured best director and best film honors in the new york film critic awards . but with the success of the mikado , gilbert tells his wife that he can't handle such happiness , " there's something inherently disappointing about success . " musicals don't get any better than this offbeat one . he is so sure of what he is doing , the film is so well researched for authenticity without having to put the film in a period straight jacket , that it retains a refreshingly modern attitude despite being properly set in victorian times . the beauty of the film , making it so much more than the typical musical , is that the director caught the environment of victorian society , allowing it to add a socio-historical perspective to the backstage dramatics of the theater people and to the travails of the g & s partnership . this historical perspective was depicted , by flashing the newspaper headline of the death of general gordon and his men in the khartoum massacre on the screen and then the film zeroes in on some actors stuffing themselves on oysters , basking in the bourgeois society the empire has made possible for them and so many others in england . but the director's main point wasn't political as it usually is , he merely wishes to show what a colossal effort it is to put on a stage show and that g & s individually would have undoubtedly found great success alone , but it is only with their collaboration that their success is so magnificent , and that we should be grateful for what their partnership gave the world . i'm also grateful that leigh made this film . i felt just wonderful leaving the theater . i knew that i saw something special .
rating:1 a poor imitation of lubitsch's classic romance/comedy trouble in paradise . even though it is terribly outdated for modern audiences , it was seen as the height of fashion at its time as for style and dress . it was a witty depression eye-pleaser for american audiences who liked to watch the rich in action , especially seeing them get robbed of their jewels .
rating:3 can you imagine that this innovative , creative film , a groundbreaker for its time , managed to virtually end the career of its great and noted director , as the subject's sexual content was too much to take for so many of the self-righteous critics of that time ! this is a film about scoptophilia ( voyeurism ) : the morbid urge to gaze , or as it is more commonly called , being a peeping tom . this fascinating film is as intensely good as any thriller done by hitchcock or chabrol . its intensity and compelling characterization of mark , is a landmark in films .
rating:2 the first thing you should be aware of about this controversial 1960 political film , shot in b&w by godard's favorite cinematographer raoul coutard , is that it was not shown until 1963 , as it had scenes in it that involved torture and terrorist tactics carried out by both the algerians and the french while waging the algerian war , which did not sit well with the french government that the public be made aware of this . writer-director jean-luc godard ( breathless ) allows his opinions to supercede the story line , making his films sound preachy and him self-indulgent . he often paints big political pictures that easily fall into generalizations . in his political assessments he is just as apt to be artless as he is to be riveting . that is the case in his second feature , the brooding atmospheric " le petit soldat . " godard did not really have a clear position on the war and wavered in his opinions of it just like the film's protagonist does , though probably having a position that was nearer to the one the right-wing had . the film was fun when it had this mixture of lighthearted romantic notions and a dark political mood to it , almost making it seem like a noir film . this results in temporarily turning off the energy the film seemed to have going for it . he says things that range from being inane to having some weight , such as bach is good to listen to at 8 am , mozart at 8pm , and beethoven at midnight . this early , minor work by godard , is a good example of how his films will later on look . le petit soldat suffers from flaws due to its poorly crafted plot and in the director's inability to tell a story that brings out all the dramatic tension . what his aim seems to be , revolves less around plot and more in telling about the stench coming from the algerian war , which is explored through bruno's intellectual musings . godard is most clear in showing that the left and right are two sides of the same coin . he is also innovative in his cinematography , challenging the conventional way of making a film by specializing in jump cuts and quick editing , which give a look of immediacy to the film . this film , thankfully , didn't have all the polemical fire in it that godard's later works had , instead there's much to find here that is enjoyable and i dare say perceptive , especially if you can overlook the director's pedantic ways . writer-director jean-luc godard ( breathless ) allows his opinions to supercede the story line , making his films sound preachy and him self-indulgent . he often paints big political pictures that easily fall into generalizations . in his political assessments he is just as apt to be artless as he is to be riveting . that is the case in his second feature , the brooding atmospheric " le petit soldat .

rating:2 as a misleading clue , one page of the diary is left on the floor .
rating:0 a " hollow-wood " production that couldn't be more hollow or hollywood in style , and to its only benefit , is visually pleasing . it presents a classic mysterious aura about it through scenes of thick fog , horrid decapitations , and framed shots as if it was a period art picture coming off its frame and onto the screen . but the story , that's a different story ; it is abominable . it is so ridiculous and incredulous that the filmmaker completely ruins washington irving's great short story . it is not the imaginative parable it was meant to be , but a story about a serial killer . so , you can forget the book , obviously tim burton did , that is if he ever read it . the film is not helped by a cast ( i might add a rather talented cast of british and americans ) that are sleepwalking through their parts . the two stars , who have inane and unappealing and underwritten roles , and seem to be acting as if they have no idea of what they are saying or doing in this film , but seem to enjoy playing it up for the camera , while showing no chemistry for any romance to be deemed possible between them ; which , without the two stars being credible performers , the film has little chance of succeeding . this film has box office appeal as a date movie for the high school set , comforting each other as they snack on popcorn ( which the theater owners will be largely appreciative of ) , and the teens , in all probability , will be reacting with bemused glee or mock horror to all the packets of ketchup unleashed during the headless horseman's romp through the sleepy hollow of 1799 . who else this movie should appeal to , is not for me to judge . but , when the audience leaves the theater , no harm is done , this is a totally forgettable film . there is no need to worry about nightmares over the gratuitous violence seen . this one is so obviously just a movie , that it can't even begin to match the book for its eloquence and the great manner of the book's very germane writing style , that is both lucid and thought provoking . if anything good can be said about this film , it would be that it brings back to the public's attention the forgotten writer washington irwing , someone who knew how to craft a ghost story back in the turn-of-the-19th-century and is still very readable . it's just too bad that a good movie couldn't result from such an accessible work . it's best to forget about this movie as in any way connected with the novel , the only thing that seems to jive is the time period , the location , and the character called ichabod crane ( depp ) . from here on , the movie is off on its own tangent , playing havoc with the story . in the movie the horseman is real , and the story becomes a vulgar mystery with some inept attempt to bring in an air of magical mystery to it , and it almost completely ignores the romantic rivalry between the two suitors , which was at the heart of irving's story . how a film could go so far afield , is not unusual for hollywood , but in this case the film has gone too far afield from the story to even claim it is based on the book . i would suggest reading the short story ( about 40-pages ) before or after seeing the film , and then see what you think of the film . i read the book after the film and am grateful that it called washington irving to my attention , again . otherwise , i can't say enough bad things about the film's crass aim to take away the imagination of the story and replace it with not one shred of what irving was after in his ghost story about romantic jealousy but here becoming a story about jejune classical horror images and a tacked on banal murder story . i'll admit , the movie looked good , better than most horror movies i might have raved about , but even with all the gory murders taking place and an excuse for a who-done-it movie evolving , a tedium set-in and the film seemed to lack suspense , breath and dimension ; and , like a beautiful person without much else , what else can you say that is complimentary after you say , you look good !
rating:2 here jaoui takes on the directing duties as well . the charm in this plot less film is that everyone presented is so much different in lifestyle and yet with all their flaws and differences , they all have something going for them that might be appealing to someone else . the story allows us to see each of their points of view clearly as their character is fully developed ; it is so smartly and subtly done without patting itself on the back , that it becomes a pleasure to watch such an intelligent presentation on the problems of love and of one developing taste . and , isn't life all about developing taste and evolving ! the more limited one is , the more limited one's friendships and love will be ! the performers all do a marvelous job of getting this across and they make the film a joy to see . it's thankfully a film that has a life of its own and shuns any formulaic way of resolving this tale , which should only disappoint zombie viewers of familiar hollywood love stories .
rating:1 the brilliant cinematography in this slasher thriller is what takes it out of the ordinary realm of such films and makes it into a diverting and more artistic venture . esteemed cult director , donald cammell ( performance/demon seed/the wild side ) , has never quite lived up to the potential he showed in the masterpiece he co-directed , " performance . " what is meant by the film's title , refers to an apache legend about those who look into the eye of violence close-up , which allows the mystical eye to have his eye on you . as a film about mysticism , it fails badly to materialize as anything but nonsense . for a film that has such a weak story and fails to be absorbing as a character study , this is , nevertheless , a well-crafted visual spectacle , featuring an array of beautifully stylized color co-ordinated scenes and out-of-the-way shots , that have little to do with the story , but overall they create a bizarre atmosphere that fits the brooding mood of the film to a tee . if it is the mystery story itself that you are looking for , i'm afraid you will be disappointed , as it adds up to nothing much . but in those visual shots . . . it might disappoint some , who think cammell could have made something more than a slasher film ; but , then again , his strength is through his eye , no matter how distorted it may be , and even in this low-rent type of film , his images remain strong and his themes have a strange complexity about them , enabling the film to be oddly effective , even when it shouldn't be .
rating:1 there is no question that one has to be careful about the good taste required when making a so-called comedy film about the holocaust , not to offend those who have suffered enough already , but that proves to be no problem here , as benigni went to some jewish organizations prior to shooting the film and got their blessings for this project . besides , i don't think there are any sacred subjects that can't be touched , it is , ultimately , the quality of the film itself that counts . and if there is another reason for not disapproving offhand the film's comic handling of this horrific context , then let's bring up the example of charlie chaplin in the the great dictator , though not directly about the holocaust , nevertheless , it was a light comedic parody of " the fuehrer " , and it was considered by many , not only to be an appropriate film , but one of the all time great films . the later part of the assessment of that film , is in recognition of that film's tremendous power to satirize nazism . benigni's film just can't muster that same power , because it has muddled and sanitized its telling of the story too much , as well-intentioned , as he might have been in trying to tell the story , the power in the telling of it is just not there . what is there , are bits and pieces of the holocaust's human story , that is as horrific a story as any one can imagine , and offers some contribution to understanding the affects of the holocaust . what he just doesn't make clear , is that the italian fascists were part of the " final solution . " benigni's film offers no explanation for this . life is beautiful , is the line trotsky said , before he was about to be assassinated , serves as the rosy title for such a downbeat subject , that is played in a hearfelt and sincere manner , even though , what it offers for nazi atrocities is for the most part the mildly anti-septic kind , reminding me of stalag 17 , or hogan's heroes tv series where the nazis are pictured as cartoon buffoons . having a horse painted green , marked as a jewish horse , makes for a colorful scene and segue to elopement for guido ( benigni ) and dora ( braschi ) , but in no way begins to symbolize or explore the deep rooted hatred that would lead to a policy of genocide . to find such truths , go way beyond the scope of this comedy star vehicle , which , instead , uses this serious subject matter for benigni to contrast his charlie chaplin like routines with the threat of genocide that is ominous , while following a story line that will not try to offend anyone , probably not even the nazis , that much , especially since benigni calls this story a fable , giving him an excuse to invent what he wants for the film . let me tell you , the holocaust was no fable . but yet , because the subject matter is so deadly serious , he is , at least , able to reach a more general audience , drawn to see such a film they would have most likely not seen , but see it because of benigni's comic ability , and in the process , he has vouchsafed for them how insane the world's prejudice against jews has been , as he makes the film's efforts seem worthy enough , even if that were all this film would accomplish , that would be plenty . but i believe he does accomplish more , but he does it , by distorting history , until , in the end , he does show the horror and tragedy of the holocaust , in his own inimical way . in the first part of the film , if you did not know that benigni's guido was jewish , you certainly couldn't tell , since he just seemed like he was an eccentric , motor-mouth italian . so , in that sense , this film in a round-about way , is erasing that stereotyped prejudice some people might still have about jews being so different from others . i was not offended by seeing comedy routines take place in a concentration camp ; i also was not touched as i should have been with the gravity of the situation , due to the comic effects . and if any one in their right mind thought that by playing some silly child game in a concentration camp they could survive , i got a surprise for them , it ain't so . the book that gave me a very truthful and precisely frank look at the daily lives of those in such predicaments , is the one by the italian chemist and former concentration survivor , primo levi , whose autobiographical , " i survived auschwitz , " shows what it really was like in those camps . that book touched me , even more than the truest film to date that i saw about the holocaust , shoah , did . after you read that book , there can be no illusions that you are in for a game in the park when you are interred in such a camp . though the italian jews had it easier than the others brought to the camp , because they came there pretty near the end of the war and therefore were not subjected to long torturous years of suffering , nevertheless , it was a place where the survivors looked like skeletons and felt as if they were already dead . the film is really made up of two parts , each with a very different feel to it . for most of this part of the film we don't even know if he is jewish , until we see the green horse and , later on , see the sign on his bookstore saying this is a jewish place , since he seems to be in some denial mode of what is really going on around him . amid a whole bag full of slapstick jokes , which probably never go out of style , since the audience where i watched the film , howled with uncontrollable laughter at all the corny bits , leaving me to wonder why i can't muster a laugh . there must be something funny about this physical humor , after all , there is a long line of vaudeville comedians who made people laugh for generations doing those schticks . i guess , this kind of comedy is just not my cup of tea , and if others find it funny and because of it , find the film endearing , then it is just a question of differing tastes . though , quite frankly , i did think most of the bits were embarrassingly crass ; for instance , those contrived scenes where he keeps bumping into his future wife , and the switching of hats ; and , the egg- in- the- face routine , i found to be especially tedious , since i find him to be more energetic and a master of good timing than outright funny . but , i also , must say , the first part of the film was easy to watch , it seemed to have a smooth and even flow to it . it's too bad she can't act , but then again , this is basically a one man show , so really , she just becomes another one of his props , much like a leading lady in a marx bros . movie is used , as a diversion to balance their comedy routines . this material is shamelessly old hat , it is only effusive because the star is so frenetic and nimble and manipulative on screen . but there were also some clever bits , like his speech , though not original , it still hit the mark , as he pretended to be a school official , giving a talk on racial superiority to elementary students where dora teaches , using his body as an example of all his superior fascist parts , such as his belly button , which is a good fascist one . this game idea could probably work for as long as a train ride from italy to germany , but for anyone to think it could work inside the camp , that would be ludicrous on their part to think so . the jews in the camp looked so well fed , that it was hard to believe that they were in a concentration camp . everyone else said their lines in a flat monotone voice that projected bad acting and because of that , almost made a mockery out of their roles . naturally the comedy routines did not work inside the camp , except for the bit where guido translates the rules of the camp for the german guards , as he makes it seem to the kid that what he is reading are the rules for the game they are playing , as he explains that the guards are only acting mean because they are part of the game . no one laughed in the audience , but this was funny in a way that you wouldn't laugh out loud funny . some slapstick was tried , such as guido's comically high stepping walk , but that got no laughs . but mostly , for this part of the film , the emphasis became on this game he was playing for his kid's sake , his love was so great for him , that he would do anything to save his life . audiences could relate to that , and that cleverly became the focal and selling point of the film . that is primarily why this film won an oscar for best foreign film , its comedy alone would not have been enough . the film , to its ever lasting credit , was able to clearly depict jews as human beings , not as objects to be reduced to soap or buttons , more human than the nazis , who have disqualified themselves from being a civilized regime by their inhumanity . this where i think life is beautful succeeded most , is being a film that inadvertly , without probably really being fully aware of what it was doing , showed how unprepared the jews were for this tragedy by being in a state of denial . which is one of the reasons why the holocaust is such a touchy subject , and one has to be careful about how one presents it to others , lest one forgets its dire consequences . and as unbelievable as it may seem , life is beautful , somehow or other , caught an interesting aspect of the holocaust , with an original take on how passive the jews were , something few films really make a major point of , for one reason or another . did the film do enough to show the horrors of genocide ? for some people it evidently did enough to leave them beguiled by the improbable mix of comedy and a holocaust . the uniqueness and likability of this film , is that benigni exploits his comic talents to take advantage of a very difficult situation , using comedy as a weapon . but this is most definetly an example of the rewriting of history , by seeing the holocaust as if it could almost be perceived as comical and not quite real , as a fable , depending on the audience itself to know fully well what happened , where only by the very end of the film , is there a realization that something terrible has happened and a tear could be shed , does a disservice to how history and the victims of it look at it and fails to recognize how little people not directly involved with the holocaust actually know about it . there is a reason why films are popular , and that reason is that people want to see what they like on screen , they as a rule , do not like to think about things that are unpleasant to them , and this film has deftly and arbitrarily accomplished that by skimming the surface off all the horrible things they could have seen , instead , it subtly goes about its business by hiding from the audience what really happened to the jews in those camps by not showing how real their plight was . this film seemed almost like it was primarily a very personal film about a father's love for his family and his great sacrifice for them , rather than a holocaust film per se . that the world is still filled with hatred , filled with other genocide campaigns , and not filled with enough people throughout the world with enough courage to put a stop to this attitude , is as plain as day . i still think that most of the world is at a low stage of the evolutionary scale and ready to do a nazi-style thing all over , if given the chance , just check out the recent serbian-kosovo conflict for affirmation that ethnic cleansing has not gone away with the end of nazism . so what can a film do ? probably , all it can do is show what really happened , and it doesn't matter if its method is drama , comedy , or even a musical , as long as it is meaningful . i intend to be very critically tolerant of this film and say , that even though it struck me as a rather thin holocaust story , it is still a worthwhile film for those who don't want or can't handle the heavier stuff , and are not put off by the comedy . they will find , if they look hard enough and look past what miramax promoted for its own purposes so it could win the oscar , a film that is more complex than it appears at first glance . but they will also find , that it is a film that still makes it evident , that the world still is in denial of what really happened , and can only look at the holocaust in a rather superficial way , even after all these years . there is still an element of world guilt , that because of that , will so highly reward this film with honors , even if the film has shown that it cannot open up both its eyes to see how real the holocaust was . but , i guess , we should thank benigni for at least opening up one eye , and letting us see that both his film's take on the holocaust and most of the world's take on the holocaust , is still bonded by denial about how they view the holocaust , which is the same mistake the italian jews made when they denied the obvious , what was right in front of their noses , until it was too late .
rating:1 catherine keener , a normally interesting actress , has nothing to do in this role but whine and act drab . cage , at all times seems wooden , never relaxed in the role . it makes one nervous just watching him trying to act a role he can't seem to get the handle on . it just never came off that way , and for a number of reasons , not the least of them being , was that cage wasn't right for the part and that he was never seen in a reflective moment undergoing a life change . the dramatics here seemed misplaced , as if they were intended more for one of the director's batman flicks , something the director brought more life to than he did with this film . but this time the look seems artificial and not well-placed , as cage is not really an introspective person , he is just someone trying to make a better life for himself at a job he is good at . and that is the main problem with the film , it has a false gritty noir look to it . this film is not the real deal , it's ersatz . therefore it never works on the intellect , instead it attacks the emotions and cheapens its efforts by pretending to delve into cage's angst . even the credible camera work , which seems too sharp-edged for the film , works against it , because it is so much better than the story and the weak acting , that it highlights even more , how artificial the film seems . the heavies of the film are all personifications of pure evil . there is nothing good about them . poole is the contact and distributor of the film . velvet is the tacky artist ; he makes the films . velvet is considered to be the jim jarmusch of s&m films . the results are as gratituous as any found in a myriad of cheap adventure films that appeal to a ready made audience , not looking for a thinking picture . the box office mistake of this film , is that it took itself seriously , somehow believing itself a thinking picture , and thereby lost both types of audiences . because those who enjoy the exploitive gore films , must have found something lacking here also , like just enough thinking to turn them off from the film . the film had perhaps one line in it that didn't seem phony , when the masked killer is unmasked and says , " the things i do--i do them because i like them . because i want to . i wasn't abused as a child . i don't hate my parents . '' it is everywhere . that dilemma might have worked as a morality play , if the acting and the story didn't seem so wooden and phony .
rating:1 the energy and vitality of these musical scores and a host of bizarrely dressed supporting performers who fill the stage with song and dance , gives this film a comical circus flavoring , which manages to cover-up its clich ? -ridden story as much as possible . it's directed with an eye for color , especially the color of rouge , by the pop-musical enthusiast , the australian , baz luhrmann ( " romeo and juliet " / " strictly ballroom " ) , an mtv type of director , who is more interested at getting at what dazzles than the why of the dazzle . the film is a series of perpetual motion shots , never pausing to delve into any character study . the problem with that , is you don't really care what happens to the lovers . the spectacle of the film is the only substance offered , and its made sumptuously beautiful for the eye to feast on . what excuses this film from being such a rip-off of other films , is that what is stolen from other films works very well here . it gives the film all the breathless moments found in other films a chance to breath again in this whirlwind of a production that is in a constant climax mode . if all it took was energy and beautiful sets and costumes , then this production would be a glorious one ; but , what this film didn't have was a love story that could touch the heart , even as it screamed out that it was all about heart . this is an easy movie to praise for being inventive and diverting , but it cannot be admired for a film that has a semblance of truth about it . it's just another enjoyable but forgettable hollywood musical , in a long chorus line of such ventures . the film has the feel in all its excesses of a ken russell type of musical crossed with any number of hollywood ones , even such an illustrious traditional one as " singing in the rain . " the wealthy duke is the heavy in this film . he is played by richard roxburgh , who plays the one-dimensional role as tritely as it is written . the film's gimmick is having 20th century musical songs and routines , that are eye popping , fill this 19th century set musical . they range from songs such as : " the sound of music , " " your song , " " diamonds are a girl's best friend , " " material girl , " " smells like teen spirit , " " like a virgin , " " lady marmalade , " " silly love songs , " " all you need is love , " " up where we belong , " " don't leave me this way , " " heroes , " " in the name of love , " and " roxanne . " this is just a partial list of songs , as the stage is always tuned for some song and dance action . all the main characters played are the usual stock archetypes--nicole kidman was eye catching as the nightclub star and courtesan who is really a sweetie for a whore , but she was too physically big to be handled in a believable way by ewan mcgregor . i was amused by john leguizamo as the rascal-like toulouse-lautrec , and jim broadbent was overpowering in his role as ringmaster of this operation . he seems to be much too stagy a thespian for these more profane hollywood actors he's surrounded by , as he stood out from them because either he was a much better actor than they were or because he hammed it up too much . in any case , his performance did stick out like someone who is thumbing a ride back to topsy-turvy . yet i felt myself partial to his performance , as in every scene he was in i couldn't help being overwhelmed by his strong presence ; though , kidman's performance was the key one of the film . she handles her part in an admirable way , showing us a lot of leg and feeling for who she was ; but , the love story had no sparks and just didn't work right . it's a film that looked good ( lots of garish colors and stardust ) , sounded fine , and felt so-so . a great escape film in the tradition of hollywood spectacles , a film that does justice to the cancan dancers of the moulin rouge . it's a fun film to let one's hair down , to sit leisurely back with some popcorn and watch this film speed across the screen ; while , from time to time peeking in on the jewel-encrusted elephant that goes for satine's boudoir , or checking in on mcgregor's impoverished artist's digs as he slaves over the typewriter with an outside neon sign shining throughout the night ( speaking of clich ? s ) .
rating:2 a great low-budget heist film noir . perennial losers in filmdom , elisha cook , jr . and stafford repp , fit right in to this plot . it made for a very entertaining film .
rating:1 takeshi " beat " kitano is certainly a unique director , whose absurdist style of filmmaking is readily recognizable , achieving auteur status . he has a fascination with gangsters , violence , and in presenting his quirky black humor in a most compelling way . his films are always visually startling , with a bevy of bizarre shots , and , so far , all his films have gotten away with a mindless but intriguing storyline . he is so fascinating to watch , that it is shame we couldn't see more of his lunacy ; instead , the supporting cast , funny as they are with their deadpan humor , nevertheless , they cannot carry the film , and kitano has chosen to center the film around them . fortunately , there are plenty of his usual visual treats in this film , that make the film seem special anyhow . kitano , also , relishes giving women roles that could be considered demeaning . though it is sickeningly amusing to see how rough-shod he treats them in so callous and an ungentlemanly manner , that one might be caught ruefully laughing at them getting dumped on and treated as garbage , and supposedly liking it and coming back for more , it still shows that he doesn't really know how to portray women on screen . maybe he knows something i don't know . but there is never any romance in his films that amount to anything , and this film is no exception . this mindless act escalates on both sides , and , of course , it makes no sense . this is all casually done , as if this kind of mayhem was as natural as eating rice cakes . if there is any point to this story , and i am not sure there is , but the message here might be , that friends are needed to help you out , no one is immune from the insanity that is in the air , because according to kitano , insanity is catching . and , if taking a stand alone against many , you are in deep trouble . somehow this visual feast of a film was strangely appealing and original in all aspects of filmmaking . so let me say bravo to the one time stand-up comedian who doesn't know how to make a safe film , and tip my eagle baseball hat to him , not only for hitting a home run , but showing that one can hit a home run but not score the needed winning run by running past the man who was on base . a cult film delight as a cruel form of entertainment , that is not for all tastes , naturally . incidently , the american title to the film , boiling point , is misleading : in japanese the title refers in slang to a baseball score .
rating:2 there are also some interesting casting choices he makes such as , a cameo for angie dickinson as gwyneth's grandmother and the noted singer huey newton in a starring role , whose expressions and looks reminded me of sydney pollack . this story is the most bizarre and implausible , but it has the strength of bringing out a number of small truths that add up , allowing the film to maintain a quirky sense of justification for its messiness . its impact is helped greatly by the engagingly nuanced performances of giamatti and braugher . the two things this film has going for it in spades , is the lively karaoke music and the unpredictability of its comedy , which gives the film a very fresh feel , even overcoming the nonsense of its interconnected stories and awkward sense of drama . these stories don't exactly connect for these disenfranchised folks , but it shows what happens to them psychologically when they come to a crossroads in omaha , making it appear to be the super bowl for dreamers in the world of karaoke -- their chance to heal their wounded egos as they steal someone else's talent for a few moments and call it theirs . the film starts off in a karaoke bar in tulsa , where ricky is a karaoke hustler , if there is such an animal as that , it's new to me -- but his thing is to bet other performers that he can top them , betting a huge sum of money over the usual $100 first-place prize . there is also a trip to omaha for the winner , where the competition is national and the prize money is significantly higher at $5 , 000 , but considering the way money has been thrown around in contests with less skill than this one , this is still a very low figure as a payoff . she does a marvelous rendition of " bette davis eyes . " but their story was rather tame , as there was nothing touching about their relationship and nothing revealed that wasn't expected , it played as if something was left out but that it wasn't important to find out what that was . yet their chemistry was good together , making their story most watchable one . the story that seemed the most forced was the cabbie and the whore on the run one . this vignette took its dramatics too seriously and explained their obvious emergency relationship in too fine a matter for how absurd it all seemed . i must applaud the film for not emphasizing the competition at the contest , as so many recent commercial films have in such films , and for taking a chance and going for some dramatic fireworks in a screwball comedy . that it doesn't always come together as a fluid film , is pushed aside by how zany and entertaining it was , with a good sense of energy released through some risks that were taken by not trying to put together a familiar film . i have a good feeling about this film and think it will stay around as a cult favorite and grow in status over the years .
rating:2 the film is marvelously acted by anjelica huston , who received an oscar nomination for best actress . it also has a tight script by donald e . westlake . it's a film that doesn't leave you with much to think about afterwards , but while it played its grit and pulp qualities shine in the darkness . the film could have been better served with a more spirited actress than bening , who's best asset is her body . while cusack seemed to not fit what a noir character should be like , as he seemed to be more like a guy who was just trying to be a good grifter . he looked like he would have fit more into a sports film than this one . but the film still works as a modern film noir vehicle , as the script didn't have depth but it provided a full blast of cynicism and shocks that played into the dark plot rather well . if it's a dark , sleazy film , that is well-crafted that you are in the mood for , then this one should be right up your alley .
rating:1 naturally , coming from them , it is a very loose interpretation of that greek classic . this film even gets its title from the part in sullivan's travels when joel mccrea , playing a successful director , wants to stop doing comedy to make instead a serious socially conscious drama called `o brother , where art thou ? ' the film will display moments of visual splendor and a riot of comedy coming about through the characterization of the three stooge-like convicts , but overall the film flags in its effort to make the story more worthy than a few skits that work . the major skit in the film , is a wonderfully choreographed ku klux klan rally that is disrupted by the boys in a comical fashion . the film reaches its climactic moment , when they sing in disguise at a political rally and get recognized with a standing ovation by the audience as the soggy bottom boys . the story seemed to die when it tried to conclude in some sane way , as the film was played mostly for the comedy , so the story had no emotional impact or little complexity to it , even though it lightly touched on racial and religious issues . there were also several obvious references to homer's epic , but mostly it was a film carried by the comedy performances of the three dimwitted characters , with george clooney showing he had an old-fashioned charm , much like the old hollywood stars , plus he has a good ear for comedy , and showed that he could carry a film . i was somewhat disappointed by this big mess of a film ( trying to depict the depression-era in the deep south as in the midst of great social changes due to anything from its music to the tva--with comedy being prescribed as a the cureall for everything ) . it was amusing and fun to watch , but could never get over its limitation -- a weak storyline .
rating:1 this fictionalized film looks as if it could be a documentary , shot in the cinema verite style . this kid's a downer , with a low attention span and a naive recognition of how messed up he is . just live in the snow . first-time director julian goldberger got into the kid's head and presented a haunting portrayal of what it is like to be lost and frightened in a world that is too complex for this junk food eating kid , who looks like a psycho with his crew-cut but is as soft as a twinkie . what the film does best besides have their unlikely antihero be the appealing voice of the film , is catch the desolate mood of the locale . what it forgets to do , is tell a good story . that the prison system is not the answer for kid's like this , is also obvious . why he was in prison is not given , but there's hints that he was picked up as a sniffer of chemicals or some other minor offense . this kid is certainly not a hardened criminal , which is the shame of it all , as there seems to be no answers from society or from this film what to do about lost souls like him . at least , the film makes clear that its position is that incarceration is not the answer , which certainly goes against the current grain of thinking in america . despite the film's good look and the way it uses a novel approach in its film language to echo what ryan is thinking , everything seems surface deep . it could have used something else to compensate for the mindlessness of ryan to go along with his painful tale of hopelessness and the film's evocative atmosphere , which wears thin after awhile .
rating:2 somehow this quirky , egocentric , fantasy black-and-white film about a british filmmaker learning to dance the tango from a master , works in an obscure way by getting us hooked on what's going on . it works so well because the dancing was so natural and magnificently performed , even if the wistful romantic story never caught my imagination and the philosophizing about her being a jew seemed more diverting than engrossing ( in real-life she's not jewish but an avowed atheist who was only influenced by her jewish neighbors and their culture ) . the 48-year-old sally potter ( she plays herself ) , while filming in paris a technicolor thriller ( it seemed like dreck and is probably some kind of personal statement potter is making about hollywood films ) about a legless fashion designer in a wheelchair murdering models dressed in brightly colored costumes . " i've always wanted to be in films , " says the thirtysomething pablo . it sounds like a trade-off in self-indulgences , and all i can say , is why not ! when sally dances the tango in the film , that's really her and not a double . and if she can dance the part , why not play the part ! for whatever arcane reason ( or most likely no reason at all ) , the story has twelve dance lessons which come to divide the film into chapters . she returns to paris after being disappointed that her hollywood backers complained that it would be better for the box office if the film was to be in english instead of french and that she should cast a different villain because it would be difficult to cast a legless person . she shoots back , " you danced as a soloist -- like a stranger -- and i lost you . " somehow i couldn't be convinced of their romance , in fact , i never cared about it . it seemed empty , and to the bargain she's no beauty . but . . . ah ! those dancing scenes were tremendous , along with the penetrating cinematography of the great robby m ? ller , giving the film such a stunning look . the film managed to look good and even though pablo and sally are no great shakes as actors , and their stiff romance was more pitiful than meaningful , the film had a bizarre strain to it , of this very uptight sally learning how to loosen up and the sly pablo jumping around like a fox at a hunt . it seemed to be a mix of reality and script , but hard to tell which was which . when they weren't dancing or figuring out what kind of arrangement they were going to have , such as if their dancing partnership would include any funny business , they discussed what it is like being a jew . i couldn't quite warm up to this debate about art . the film is short on plot , short on acting , short on getting me involved in the romance , but most of the film had potter and veron dancing and that had me jumping with joy , even believing that there was something spiritual to the tango , a dance which is a mixture of cuban and european styles , created by the lower-classes and elevated to the status of the ballroom , a dance created in this century , that maybe is even akin to the rapturous eastern european klezmer music . this is an inspiring dance film that covers some ground in exploring what the tango is and how that dance reflect's one's life and suffering , and to understand that is to begin to understand what the tango is about and what this film was trying to get at .
rating:2 raising arizona ( director/writer : joel coen ; screenwriter : ethan coen ; cinematographer : barry sonnenfeld ; cast : nicolas cage ( h . a very funny spoof about a colorful couple who must have a child and will try to get one by any means possible . through the use of a voiceover , emanating from h . i . as the narrator , the logical sequence of the story is followed . the film has its moments of serious pauses , as h . i . there are a few more complications along the way , as h . i . here the comedy was predictable chevy chase sort of material . the coen brothers know how to make a quirky film and they sure know how to write side-splitting dialogue . and if you are looking for something heavier , like a lesson to be gotten from all this or a searing comment on society , maybe you could even find that here also . though sometimes the comic situations and the way all the characters talk funny , seem forced , it still recovers from these lapses and bounces back with more off-the-wall situations once reserved for " keystone cop " comedies , like ferocious dogs chasing the hero , improbable victories for our improbable hero while fighting goliaths , and store clerks who have hidden vengeance inside them . if it is absurd comedy that makes you do cartwheels , something that is unique and dark enough to have some bite in it , then this film is funny enough to overcome some of its failing moments .
rating:3 dariush mehrjui is one of iran's finest modern filmmakers , his speciality is making films about relationships among the upper-middle-class illuminati , and especially love stories about women . this drama is a very powerful , poignant and mesmerizing love story , about the pressures of dealing with moslem traditions and of a woman's own sense of being . why this marriage should turn ice cold , when everything is so blissful , is amazing to watch as it unfolds . this is a truly heartbreaking tale without contrivances , that examines a woman's psyche , looking carefully at her wants and her expectations . reza is never forceful enough in his statements telling her that it doesn't matter that she can't have children , as leila has nagging doubts about whether he really means it or is just saying it . the couple have all the creature comforts of modern life and act like modern people do , and are seen playfully watching dr . zhivago on tv together , but tradition is also very strong . this is a very compelling and subtle film , on one hand it shows the current conflict in iran between modernity and islamic tradition , but on the other hand , this is a penetrating film about the universal problem of love , as seen through the psyche of a woman who is stripped of her self-esteem , and even though she is beautiful and has a considerate husband , she is still not sure of what her role is in society . this is a very sensitive tale ; it is film that was convincing in every possible situation it presented ; it is the work of a great director .
rating:3 at last , a black comedy , coming-of-age , romantic melodrama about teenagers in rebellion that is not a formulaic clich ? d one and actually makes an attempt to flesh out the character of a teen who is searching for something that is not trivial , as she lashes back at being stuck in the urban sprawl scene of la that is inhabitated by so many shallow and phony people . it's filmed by documentary filmmaker terry zwigoff , a nerd himself , who gave us the excellent documentary crumb . she promises much to enid and , as one might expect , delivers little . it is one that seymour is willing to have even if it means he has to compromise all his beliefs to keep it going , as he curiously says " i don't want to meet someone who shares my interests . i hate my interests . " through his unapologetic loneliness she sees her own , and even though this film is not geared for a predictable or a happy ending , it's this relationship with all its incongruities that is so fascinating , touching and tender to behold . it certainly sharpened their awareness of who they were , and the poetical ending is fitting for a free flowing story like this one . i honestly can't remember how long its been since i have seen a teenage film as memorable as this one ( rushmore comes the closest ) .
rating:0 the nightmarish scenes seem surpassed by cinematography techniques , allowing the story to move into the realm of make believe hollywood hokum rather than relying on the viewer's imagination to do the job . the irish-born director , jordan , whose accomplishments include a few first-class films among some disappointments , only proves here , that the horror thriller , perhaps , is not what he is best suited for . his heavy-handed direction , helped only in spoiling a fine cast from doing what it is capable of . jordan's idea of a horror thriller , seems to be in letting the heroine to act in a shrill voice , rather than letting the heroine's nightmare and mental breakdown come down as something internally real . if jordan went down the poetic trail instead of opting for this gobbledy-gook he comes up with , then we might have had a solid film to comment on . it was the only scene in the movie that was able to convey how believable her panic attacks really are . i think he's delusional if he thinks he got a real part in this film . his role is so insignificant , even more so than aidan quinn's , as to make stephen rea , seem less like a star than one of the film's extras . here , he is playing the role of vivian thompson , by making his villain role as campy as he could , managing to give the impression that he is a totally evil pervert , possibly even gay . downey jr . basically brought a sense of the ridiculous to this role , allowing the film to sink lower than than the ordinary hollywood horror film usually does . the film's intellectual theme , if i can loosely use the word intellectual , is a reversal of " snow white " , as this time the story is not narrated from the child's point of view , but from the mother's . an adult freudian tale , i suppose . the film just becomes a mess and the acting is constantly shrill . it is a film that can't be saved by good looking photography , or diffuse symbolism , or even by great special effects , but must be viewed wallowing in its own unpleasant reservoir of putrid storytelling .
rating:1 a wonderfully hokey b-movie , that is a derivative thriller from the director with all the gimmicks , william castle ( tingler ) . here he uses a fright-clock on screen , giving those audience members who are too frightened to see the scary conclusion , a chance to leave the theater . we don't have showmen like castle around anymore , instead we got corporate executive types running the studios , looking only at the bottom line . they have taken the fun out of promoting a movie and have made it just another stale business marketing venture . castle also effectively features in homicidal a lot of copycat things from other films , such as the psychotic mannerisms of the killer , which was lifted straight out of psycho . that the story makes absolutely no sense and has more holes in it than swiss cheese , is besides the point . it's obvious that he will grow up to be a sick one . the pyscho-dynamics of this twisted yarn , as they unfold , are a real hoot to watch . emily and warren ( jean arless ) speak in unnatural stilted tones , while karl and miriam go out together and are so sugary sweet that one could hyperventilate by just watching them . homicidal is a classical horror film , but featuring mediocre acting and plot ; its one gigantic plus is the interesting characterization by jean arless , who seems to be swimming in a different stream than the rest of the cast . the ending is predictable but fun to watch , and for that matter , this shamelessly exploitative film is a total gas . castle himself introduces the film , and thereby gets you in the right mood to see this shocker . if you are in the proper humor for a movie that doesn't take itself that seriously , you have nothing to lose by seeing it , which is the attitude the bellboy had when he mumbled just those sentiments to himself before accepting the bizarre marriage proposal offered him by the seemingly attractive blonde . this is the kind of film that defies critical analysis , if you're in the mood for schlock-shock , this could be a most entertaining film .
rating:1 a feel-good , old-fashioned ( except for all the cuss words ) , liberal message movie for the people and by the people , resulting in a populist film . it surprised me in how invigorating a performance there was from julia roberts ( she usually turns me off ) , and how there was such a good chemistry between her and the gruff albert finney . but , the subtle performance by the rumpled looking finney , playing second fiddle without a hint of a complaint , as his panned reactions to her antics made her star quality shine more brightly , was the key to the film's success . his role is a paper-thin one , as the sensitive , long-suffering lover . it reminds me of the role hollywood usually reserves for the sweet but simple lady co-star , who is just around to make the star look good . julia roberts's breasts are propped up and very noticeable , wearing tight-fitting clothes with low necklines , at all times . when told by the boss " you might want to rethink your wardrobe a little , " she retorts , " i think i look nice , and as long as i have one ass instead of two , i'll wear what i like . " the film was all about her . it plays pompously proud of itself like the do-gooder fare it is , with no real emotions shown for the victims , as it only shows the pain julia feels for them . this one's all about julia roberts , and if you buy into her for the part , you are more than likely to be pleased with the film . as for my reaction , i felt , what the hell , the utility company acted so maliciously evil and the outcome of the case is documented , so what i would not have accepted so readily from a drama , i found myself accepting in this political conscience film . where i saw the film , the same type of working-class clients of julia's , were in the audience and were laughing lustily at the jokes , and they seemed to enjoy seeing this big company being taking on by one of them . this mainstream film by steven soderbergh ( sex , lies and videotape/out of sight/the limey ) , is shot in a sitcom conventional style , without most of the director's usual artististic flourishes from his past films . there have been many hollywood films of this type , including , silkwood , a civil action , and norma rae , with this film somewhere in the middle of the entertainment scale when held in comparison .
rating:1 but if the plot was silly , the fun in this charlie chan story was in watching number one son ( keye luke ) run around like a chicken without a head , seeing charlie overcome being shot in the leg and being kidnapped , and how the film captured the racetrack atmosphere . it makes for a satifactory but not an always well-developed mystery film .
rating:2 a thoroughly enjoyable film about a pitiless serial killer of middle-aged women , that is played for laughs at the expense of the women victims . it is a black comedy , acclaimed for its stellar performances , especially by rod steiger as christopher gill , the psychologically warped killer , with a severe mother fixation , who uses a number of disguises to commit the murders and performs the murders as if he was on-stage , being only natural , considering that he is an accomplished broadway actor and well-known theater owner , and the son of a great actress . this presents an interesting contrast with the way the killer handles his neuroses . his performance is endearing and heckart's is amusingly right on target . she is delightfully refreshing , offering her beauty , sensitivity , and comedy in a splendid performance . this is an actor's film and they all make the most of it . steiger calls him the next day and offers to become segal's telephone confidant , but tells him , " remember , i am smarter than you are . " it was difficult not to find this witty film funny and its romantic subplot equally charming .
rating:1 siegel misfired with this mild western comedy . the film was hampered by a dull story and an uninteresting performance by shirley maclaine playing a nun hiding the fact that she's a prostitute . a typical eastwood cowboy scene , played in clint's graceful languid style , as he puffs on his cigar , quietly snarls , and does what the filmmaker hopes most in the audience would love to do in real-life . once inside , they machete the soldiers , make them into human torches , or just shoot them . it's all predictable and formulaic ; it could have used a big time rewrite .
rating:2 it's a slow-moving visual piece , setting a bleak moody atmosphere as it touches on voyeurism and misplaced love and obsessions and childhood abuse . the film's title comes from an elvis costello song of the same name . this ill-fated relationship comes to a sudden tragic culmination , which gives power to all the visual images leading up to this surprising climax . he's so obsessed that he can't make love to the more than willing smokey , as he burns inside from anger and alienation and frustration . but the story is too slight to make much inroads into those deep emotional directions , except the power in the film comes from the aftershocks that set in long after viewing the film . it mainly holds one's interest because the story is so oddly told and all the characters seem to have dark sides ready to burst open at any time . when they do , it seems to make sense . its best feature comes by way of polish cinematographer slawomir idziak , who uses his noted method of filtered filming to great advantage here to capture the angst of the characters and their dark love life .
rating:1 there have been very few films about the american revolution and most of them have been terrible , with the exception of d . w . at least , they kept it moving at a brisk pace , but , unfortunately , they used a good deal of violence . there were a multitude of choreographed battle scenes , face-to-face combat scenes , and sweeping panoramic shots of the beautiful countryside , which should take your mind off all the empty messages of the film . the filmmaker even made slavery appear as not such a bad thing by having the slaves seem more like workers than slaves , they just seemed to be having themselves a good old time on the plantation . when the 158-minutes are up , you might not have much of an historical perspective of the war , but you should feel good that the arch villain got his just desserts . the colonel's villain role is about as one-dimensional and predictable as it gets for such a villain , whereby he becomes more cartoonish and less menacing as the story rolls on . and there you have the plot , which is not much on history and not much on character development . everything is so predictable about this glossy photographed film , everything is so banal , everything seems so dishonest , and the dialogue is so disparaging , that i found this to be such a morbid attempt at history , such a futile way to tell a story . everything from the acting and the script was flat . everyone was reduced to a cardboard figure , and the war seemed to be a manufactured one , as if this film was made as a tv episode . the story lacked vitality , only scoring points for its fine costumes and john williams musical score . the film always seemed to be an unhealthy mixture of mawkishness and carnality , offering nothing but shallow responses for all its preaching about freedom . only this film comes with some bogus history lesson thrown in , which makes it more shamefully exploitive , a " payback " with the redcoats as the gangsters . i had an ugly feeling when i left the theater , like someone was trying awfully hard to sell me on patriotism : using children , the flag , a horrid villain , all to shamelessly stir me up , instead of telling me a story about a credible character who got involved in the war for independence .
rating:1 warning : spoilers throughout review . the star of this film is pal's special effects , orchestrated by gordon jennings , which won an oscar . the acting was wooden , the romance was blah , and the religious messages tacked on were pathetic . but this sci-fi spectacle had much in it to be praised for ; it was especially scary , the martian design was sleek and ominous ( there were spider-like characters with cobra-like heads ) , and the recreation of an atomic bomb blast was spectacular . it wisely stuck to the theme of mankind's arrogant belief of his own superiority rather than go the red menace route as most sci-fi films of that day did . in the lab the scientists study samples of their blood collected and the martian electronic eye forrester salvaged , which the martians use as a periscope , leads the scientists to the conclusion that the martians are physically primitive even if they are mentally superior to us . they also have anemic blood and because of the darkness of mars , it's 140 million miles away from the sun , they can't handle a strong light .
rating:2 honestly . spoiler in the next paragraph . their superb characterizations about the cowboy's hard life and romantic visions , living as loners , often traveling on dusty roads into one-horse towns while hanging out in tawdry bars , gives this film a special force , filled with a moody noirish atmosphere .
rating:3 first-time film director and former music video director spike jonze has come up with a tantalizing feast for the self to nosh on , cooked by charles kaufman's original screenplay , that offers up some very intangible delicacies on its plate , such as a psychological , personal and sexual identity study , allowing the eater to suspend belief about what is being digested and be allowed to tastefully enter into the mind of another being . it is a playful and provocative look at determining one's identity and how celebrity is viewed from within , featuring an actual celebrity , the performer , john malkovich , who is playing himself , as the mind who is being entered . if someone could market via virtual reality how to actually do that , it might cost as much as $200 for a 15 minute sightseeing trip down that path , the charge established in the film for such a trip , while for the movie viewer it is only for the nominal cost of a movie ticket that one gets to have such a unique experience . the running gag being , that the overhead and the rent are also low here . since the glimpse into malkovich's head is more or less fictional , it's delightfully funny to find craig turning up inside the man's head and to find the actor eating toast and reading the wall street journal in his park avenue apartment . the film was brilliant in spots but towards the end ran out of enough nourishing food to sustain its steady diet of farcical comedy . but even as it was petering out , it still managed to have enough brilliant glimpses at celebrity and how some crave that sort of identity , to make it both hilarious and somewhat intellectually appealing , and leave off with an ending that is unnerving . what makes this insane premise work out so surprisingly well , is that the actors get the joke and run with it , even flushing out seemingly irrelevant things about one's inner being along the way that are fun to scrutinize . and if anything more can be said about john malkovich than that he is a grand actor , it is that he comes across as a good person , someone with a good sense of humor and someone who is able to heartily have a laugh at himself even if it is supposedly at his own expense . this is the kind of strange film that one would expect to be released as an art-house indie , yet here it is playing as a mainstream big production .
rating:1 after all , it's still " home , sweet home . " the old-fashioned values displayed give the film a dated look , and all the manipulative situations prevent this film from being viewed as anything but a star vehicle , which should be pleasing for pickford fans . she's a real charmer , with a good cinema presence . the film had a few heartwarming moments : mom dancing an irish jig , terry taking his date pickford home and then -- climbing up the rickety steps of the tenement and looking chagrined as he was thwarted from kissing her as she toyed with him , and there was also the playful mood displayed by pickford with all the men in her life , not a bit envious of her so-called betters , proud of the inner character she has . . . even the film should be of special interest to mary pickford fans and to those who want to see why she was considered " america's sweetheart . "
rating:1 the problem with epics of this grand design , is they could never be dramatic enough and fall prey to episodic incidents to tell their story . that is the case here , as the story was leaden and didn't seem to move , as it plodded along linear lines and political regimes , from monarchy to fascist and finally to communist regimes . the filmmaking , though well-intentioned and intelligently presented , was just too dull and uninspiring to sustain interest in the lesson it is trying to teach about the mess bigotry and politics makes , even if the lesson is an important one and shouldn't be ignored . the film was also bereft of any subtlety , its messages were of the kind that hit you over the head with a loud thud . there are a few scenes that stand out because they were either so awkward , or because they had a raw power in them that was not found in the rest of the film . the drivel that comes out of that dialogue goes something like this : " i love you . . . but the point being made , in all the belabored efforts of the filmmaker , is that political regimes , materialism , and all causes are temporary , and that religions tend to be divisive . the film shows how assimilation can't work , changing your name can't work , being a good family and trying to be loyal to an oppressive regime can't work , passivity can't work , there is nothing that the jew can do to make those who hate him like him . i felt drained after seeing this epic , not from joy , but from weariness of all the messages i was receiving . he goes on to say , " i predict this will be a century of love , justice and tolerance . " this was the only irony found in the film , a film that just couldn't get its complex view across on what went went wrong for the jew in the anti-semitic world of austria-hungary , without being a drudge .
rating:1 it's a colorful adventure story of saloon brawls , romance , and corruption . the brawl was unrealistic but marvelous to watch . the stellar cast of stars and noted supporting players keep the action rolling , as everyone seems just right for the parts they are playing . marlene couldn't be sexier , wearing brocades and gowns , changing from one gown to another at the drop of a beer stein . for comic moments , there is the dialogue between marlene and black maid marietta canty , who is yearning for a black dude to appear in the yukon .
rating:1 a routine aip action-packed ww11 drama of heroism . if you like a no-nonsense war story of all action , no big-name stars , and one that validates courage . . . you got it in this solid low-budget actioner .
rating:3 a . i . this is one of the great dark comedies of the 1950s . the opening scene is a memorable one . he begins by saying : " i would like to say a few words about weddings . i've just been through one . " even the caterer ( leo g . carroll ) , proves to be an unpleasant problem to deal with , as stanley wryly says , " an experienced caterer can make you ashamed of your house in fifteen minutes . "
rating:1 it asks the question , how would you react in finding out that your world is not real ? this is a theme a number of '90s sci-fi films have already done . it seems as if the movies are running out of ideas for this world and need the after-life for more material . supposedly , i am being prepared for a film that will make me think . instead , what i got was a sci-fi film that left me somewhat confused by its being both a murder mystery and a time travel sci-fi'er . it was very difficult to keep track of what was going on , as the film moved back and forth between two different time frames . it was also difficult for me to grok what is meant by the creation of parallel dimensions and how it is possible for our world to be a copy of another . what made it even more difficult , was that the story line was built around the murder case and not around the more interesting ideas generated by time travel . yet , it was this virtual reality computerized world that left me dazzled with its engrossing ideas . though the film tried , it simply couldn't create too much depth for its characters . they remained tied to the sci-fi part of the story . they performed their task well , but their characters couldn't expand because of the limitations they were presented with . they just didn't have too much sparkle to them . even the romance between the leads was jejune . this proved to be a fatal flaw in the film . these creations have feelings and emotions just like people ; but they don't know they're not real . it is too dangerous . yes . the 13th floor , directed by josef rusnak from a screenplay he wrote with ravel centeno-rodriguez can be valued for its re-creation of a 1937 los angeles of fancy bars , booming oil wells , and a magnificent wilshire boulevard setting . all this ostentation taking place in the middle of our great depression . it was fun to see this opulent depiction of a town that was to only grow more opulent and depressed in the future . in this most original story , it seems hannon has made one too many simulations himself and now wants to abort this project . i got mixed messages from this film . i thought it was an interesting concept , that somehow didn't seem as exciting as it should be on the first viewing . i will reserve final judgment on it , since i think it could look better upon seeing it again . as for the flatness of the characters , that i'm afraid won't change . but i must say , i thought the actors did a really fine job considering the limitations placed on them by the script . . . also , the filmmakers did a good job with their use of costume and set designs . i wanted to like this film more than i actually did , but i couldn't fully enjoy it , for the simple reason that too much of the film was taken up by the uninteresting murder case .
rating:2 a more-than-acceptable variation of jacques tourneur's cat people ( 42 ) , that is excellent in spots , but lags in its overall pacing . the scene is marvelously done , as it cuts away from the leopard's attack to picture leonora enjoying this revenge . though very imitative of the tourneur film and not quite as masterfully done , this rarely shown horror film is worth catching for its dark intensity and the eerie mood it sets .
rating:3 this is a grim morality tale that can't help putting you in someone else's shoes , wondering what you would do if you were in the same situation . instead , he does the most savage thing he could possibly do , he gets igor , who is becoming very squeamish at this point , to help him bury amidou in concrete , even if he is aware that amidou is still barely alive . how cruel can people be to others ! . . . but something has happened to the kid . la promesse has the harsh reality to it that a documentary might have , and considering that the sibling film directors are acclaimed documentary directors for over two decades , it is easy to see that even though this story is fictionalized it , neverthess , is filmed in the manner of the very real experiences that the filmmakers have noted going on in modern europe . the three main characters of the story are cast perfectly . the film could have been done from the father's point of view instead of the son's ; and , even more interestingly , from assita's ( the widow ) way of seeing things , and the film would have still had a tremendous impact . but there is an unmistakable presence she has , that clearly shows the nobility of her character , especially when contrasted with all those around her whose minds are so blemished . roger is one of the slimiest guys you could ever meet , someone who tries to pretend he is good but it so obviously not , that it is written all over him what he really is . there is room for us to see in him what makes him act the way he does , that he is not that far removed from the consciousness' of the ordinary man in the street , except for his utter lack of decorum and any sort of social conscience . from his point of view , we could see that he is only looking out for number one , thinking , that if he doesn't , who else will . but they can't see anything wrong . this powerful tale is unflinchingly honest and moving . it casts a dark shadow over a civilized country's technological prowess in the world , and questions its humanity and moral perspectives . it does so in a most tangible way , in a way that should be a disturbing reminder of how complex the problem of immigration is , in a film that is piercingly on target as a challenge for the european countrys to keep their " promise " to the immigrants and to see how corrupt their system is and how it doesn't really stop these powerless people from being exploited .
rating:2 stanley kubrick until his untimely death was working on a project that weighed for a long time on his mind -- the subject of artificial intelligence . steven spielberg is given the blessing by the kubrick estate to take over that project , and he brings his great craftsmanship skill as a visual story teller to the film while paying homage to kubrick's intentions and themes he wanted developed . he succeeds for most of the film in keeping it tight while presenting an occasional riveting psychological moment or two , as he tells a fairy tale for adults ; it's a version which will go way over the heads of children and many of the adults . what he does is put the pinocchio fairy tale , the frankenstein story , and the oedipus myth in his warm-hearted blender and gives them a good mixing up . he also takes full credit for the script and does not include kubrick as co-screenwriter ; he only credits him with the film's idea . what spielberg fails to do is tell the fairy tale ending in the same artistic way a kubrick would have displayed his mastery of telling a good mystery story . it was a thoughtful climactic touch but what the film demanded for it to be considered as a masterpiece , is a more lyrical note to end it on ; which is the most glaring fault of the film . what spielberg delivers is a film that leaves you thinking about what the end of human civilization means and how close to artificial intelligence can the world be as its reality , and about how love is something that can't be programmed without something being amiss about it . it also does not have spielberg's usual dosage of sentimentality , which has played havoc with most of his previous films . it's a splendid film that pays homage to both himself and kubrick for their noteworthy films . t . . it's a hollywood film that defies what a hollywood film is about , while in essence still being a hollywood film of excesses and special effects . this is one of the best films spielberg has ever made , and his most thought-provoking one . it has much of both giant filmmakers locked into this story , though it's a spielberg film and not a kubrick one . a . i . is set in the near-future , mid-21st century , as narrator ben kingsley explains that the melted ice caps are a common sight . the sight of nyc submerged under the ocean is both bleak and visually satisfying . what is hinted at , is that we are just beginning to see what the possibilities there are in a . i . . but in order for the robots to have a live intelligence and not merely a programmed one , they will have to be created like nature creates its plants and animals . it is this possibility that will always leave them flawed , but with the potential to push evolution to new levels . the second half of the story becomes layered with more complex themes and harder to answer questions . it's a spiritual odyssey about creation that david takes in the hardened nocturnal world of what remains of urban civilization , which is a reflection of a literary hell . it's here that spielberg asks questions about humanity that he has never asked before in his more lightweight films : he questions family values and wonders about scientific and religious definitions of creation , and he most of all wonders if humanity is only one link in evolution that raises consciousness and that if it becomes obsolete what will be the other ways to evolve . it's an imaginative film , that has a lot going for it except exciting dialogue . i couldn't ask for anything more from spielberg ; he has taken on kubrick's depth and artistic integrity in filmmaking , at least , for this film ; he has paid homage to kubrick , and has made a highly personal film . this might disappoint many in the mass market audience that are attracted to spielberg for other reasons and might expect to see another kiddie pic like e . t . . but the film will also attract a more sophisticated sci-fi film crowd , that should connect this film with a " 2001 " cyberspace experience .
rating:1 a beautiful piece of junk , amounting to a spectacle for the eyes only , as the film itself couldn't justify the violence and human depravity shown . this surreal thriller amounts to a beautifully photographed and stylish film . there is no rational payoff to explain what is happening except this is some pretty sick stuff we are seeing . it's a vile film , that tries to take the film down the same road as coppola's " the conversation " and where a number of other morally blurred films about voyeurism had gone , aiming mostly , perhaps , along the lines of brian de palma's suspenseful works . it works into its story devices from a multitude of other films , except this one just didn't add up and seemed to dwell on the grisly violence the woman psychopathic killer commits and offered no valid critical reason to justify all the gore in this beautiful looking but pointless film . lang flatly plays a sympathetic agent in eye's workplace who always appears on a laptop screen . since nothing in this film made sense , why should one expect her role to ! so the film ends as clumsily and distantly as it was throughout . as all we get from this film are some cheap exploitive thrills and a tease that there is some intellectual message hidden in all the mental gymnastics , but what we really have , is a film that failed to get untracked .
rating:2 the concept of illumination , whence the title of the film comes from , refers to st . augustine's theory of enlightenment . it is what fills the mind with light ; it is a spiritual happening that is the most powerful thing in the world . the hero is likable , somewhat courageous and scholarly , a person of integrity and loyalty , and is the only hope for poland's future . this is a glum film , but intellectually sound , offering many pleasurable introspective moments , but lacking in real illumination , which prevents it from being a great film . that is certainly an arguable statement , as even the protagonist in the story eventually realizes not everything can be settled by rational arguments .
rating:2 a triumph of quirkiness over a hackneyed western story to make it a very appealing film that varies slightly from the genre . it was one of the best low-budget westerns that the noted director joseph h . lewis made in his long and distinguished career , as he chose to retire from the film industry with this film . there was some controversy surrounding this film as it was probably not good for anyone's career to appear in it , as many in the production were either blacklisted or were subpoenaed to appear before the house of un-american activities committee . it was skillfully made , had style and the expressions of an auteur filmmaker to make it standout from other westerns .
rating:1 a solid action thriller directed by alfred hitchcock . but it has many plot flaws and suffers from poor pacing and can best be perceived as a precursor to his much improved other 'framed innocent man pic , ' north by northwest . the film draws to an action conclusion , with barry and fry mixing it up on the statue . the film can be forgiven for its many patriotic speeches extolling the virtues of america , since there was a war taking place . but it can't be forgiven for how shoddy the story line was and how you can just about challenge every scene in this film as being fake . when the nazi ring gets cummings in nyc , there's no way they would handle him so casually , making his escape seem so easy , as they didn't even tie him up . when taken to nyc by baxter , a call would have been placed to kruger exposing cummings , which for some unexplained reason wasn't done . the other major flaw was that cummings and lane were much too bland to give this story personality . hitch's first choices of gary cooper and barbara stanwyck would have made the film that much more charismatic , though cummings and lane were not that bad as much as they were colorless .
rating:0 the film is a muddled effort to make them into hero and heroine , and the effort to do that seemed to misfire somewhere in the long sea journey home for wayne . why this is so , sure beats me . napier fires on the freighter and destroys it . the film ends in mystery , as it is not certain if ehrlich and elsa escaped or were killed . as for me , i could care less--this was one of the duke's poorer films . it was a tedious chase and an irrelevant story , and the dialogue was just atrocious . this letterboxed version was watchable only to see how lana acts while wearing furs , evening dresses , and tight sweaters aboard the freighter .
rating:0 this parody of other gangster films suffers from a bad case of mindless imitation and hapless comedy that might be funny to someone in japan , but does not have a universal appeal . it is a parody of how the yakuza is portrayed in kitano films . it also pays homage to many other gangster films from around the world , including france's " diva . " it tries to take dramatic situations that occurred in those films and apply them out of context here , by poking fun at the hit man's mystique . sawaki when asked about his work , just feels his job is dull . noguchi asks him , " does your heart ever thump with excitement like it did when you were a kid ? " the fun in the film is mainly for film buffs , who will spot a wide variety of gangster films being used as a source for the levity here . the film's conclusion is a mixture of madcap comedy and an attempt to give meaning to all the lives of the dreamers who befriended sawaki . humor is subjective , you can't convince anyone that something was funny when they aren't laughing . i didn't laugh at what i was seeing , though i found the film to be stylish , shot in an outpouring of mellow brown and blue-gray shades .
rating:2 the plot develops around how tenuous such office friendships can be , and how death-like is the atmosphere they work in , and how frighteningly transient everything seems to be . that society can be repressive and authoritarian , is still true today , as this film encourages you to see and think about what has really changed after all the women's lib movement agendas and all the other changes in the workplace that have been accomplished , especially for women , and if these changes have really made life better for them . a gem of a small movie . . . adeptly uncovering the need for positive relationships and the need for solidarity in a hostile workplace , which might as well be a metaphor for how to handle yourself in the world . and even though , no smug answers were given as how to accomplish this , one does have choices ; at least , you can start by facing up to yourself and your situation , and not just marking time and staying put on a job that bores you . this movie definitively brought up a topic a lot of people are concerned about , and even if it said it in a low voice , its message can be heard above the idle chatter in the office , if you are tuned in to the right cubicle .
rating:2 this made-for-tv thriller provides plenty of mystery . it's a story that crosses religion and spiritualism with worldly cynicism and murder . arquette is excellent in an understated performance . robards brings a certain sense of tragic power to his role . while under the capable direction of mike hodges ( get carter ) , the film is superbly paced and plays up the ambiguity of the story in a satisfactory manner . the result is a stimulating film for the intellect and a challenge for establishing what one's reality is .
rating:3 this indie film is filled with many gratifying small touches , as it takes its time developing and forces one to tune into the way victor sees things . this is the kind of human interest story that hollywood slicks up and can't make in quite the same realistic way that a good indie film can be made , that takes its time in bringing out a number of small truths , so that by the time the story winds down , a big climactic ending is not needed , all the pain and pathos has already been drawn out of it . in contrast to victor's gentle nature , he's always high-strung . the film works so well because the performers are outstanding and the writer/director has come through with a very touching debut effort . there is something precious about this film , whether in shelley winters warm performance as a giving but possessive mother , or from pruitt taylor vince's priceless performance of someone who hardly speaks and is a doting son , longing for love and friendship , but who still hasn't matured , or from liv tyler's refreshing role as the one who breeds life into the dead feelings of both mother and son , giving them some hope for the future . the musical score arranged by thurston moore helped set the quiet mood needed for the story to gently unfold . everything about this original film was honest and natural . all the characters know what loneliness is , even if they mask it better than the mama's boy does , and because of that , it is easy to relate to their very demanding problems of loneliness and how it has eaten away at them -- making some fat , others blind to what they are , or bitter .
rating:1 douglas fairbanks plays his first action hero role as zorro , the sort of part he will play for the rest of his film career , before this very popular film he was cast only in light comedies . he is dressed in a black mask-and- cape , which gave the role a certain amount of appeal to audiences . the film is not much on character study , instead it's filled with action sequences and a melodramatic love story between zorro , who hides his true identity of being the son of the aristocratic rancher don alejandro ( de gray ) , and the sweet lolita pukido ( marguerite ) . there is no mistake about who the goodguys and who the badguys are in this childlike adventure story . it reminded me of a charlie chaplin routine , the one where he's the tramp and is kicking the cop in his behind . the film disappointed me in many ways , not the least being , that his plan to help the poor , seemed misplaced , and that this was more a story of aristocrats and those of wealth versus bad politicians rather than the robin hood story it projected itself to be . it was really a stretch to believe that the noble zorro was anything but a rich aristocrat having a bit of sport , and finding love with someone he could have easily found love with anyway without going through his masquerade . the story itself was a cliche , featuring his cardboard-typed father wanting his son not to be an idler and make something of himself , while the son feigns being fatigued all the time and acting effeminate , performing silly magic tricks when he should be seriously courting the eligible senorita his father fixed him up with . it was the type of part you can almost expect to see in a film like this , and one that is void of any real human emotions . there are no surprises in this predictable costume actioner , but it is pleasantly shot in b&w with a tinted look to it . it should please those who like their films to be lighthearted . because it was such a successful film box-office wise and was a precursor to the type of film hollywood is noted for putting forth , it could be interesting just to see how this silent yarn compares with the viewer's take on the more modern action films .
rating:1 an enjoyable monogram made charlie chan mystery , with much trickery disguising who the real culprit is and a very clever premise but one that is not always well executed . this is accomplished through working the corpses like a puppeteer does the puppets , therefore it appears as if the dead person is walking . there was a flurry of one-liners , confusius-like sayings , and some stereotype racial fright humor by moreland exhibited . it all made for an entertaining but not totally satisfying film .
rating:1 a fairly-routine ww11 action-packed film . the best thing that could be said about the film , is that it avoids a lot of the usual cornball war film clich ? s about the brotherhood between the troops . its rise in critical evaluation over the years , where it was once reviewed as a typical war movie but now because of siegal's rising star as a director , has been granted " cult status , " which resulted in receiving much higher praise than i think it deserves . what siegel did for this b&w film , along with ww11 expert robert pirosh , was tighten up the script , make it more suspenseful , and emphasized the psychological differences between the few men of the 2nd squad and the pyschopathological attitude of the mcqueen character . the film opens in montigny , france-1944 . after the men spot this , newhart goes into a telephone routine he used as a stand-up comedian , but only here it is not funny and seems out of place . this is a film that builds to a climax for its brutal payoff . the men seem to think that this makes sense . he won't do anything until he clears it with pike . pike in a friendly gesture asks reese : " were you right ? " reese responds : " how the hell do i know . " >from the film's title , you can determine how the film will end , as the men prepare to attack the german pillbox , strengthened by company reinforcements . the film can make claim to its antiwar sentiments by showing the insanity of the attack . for me it was just another war film , nothing special .
rating:1 a fair remake of the 1930 and 1920 versions of this film . a very conventional film .
rating:1 a gothic mom-in-distress thriller for those who might believe in ghosts or at least are open-minded , or for those who like a scary puzzler story to be grounded in those old-fashioned techniques of getting at the human emotions rather than being a computerized technical special-effects production of the supernatural . the 29-year-old acclaimed chilean-born , spanish-based director , alejandro amen ? bar ( open your eyes/thesis ) , provides a surprise ending to this chiller , which the clever viewer might guess since there are enough clues laid down . that's something " the sixth sense " did , but there it worked better because the story was more plausible and less artsy , so when the surprise ending resulted it seemed more satisfactory than in amen ? bar's film . the dark and somber tone of amen ? bar's film lingers for too long to make it seem anything more than an atmospheric and stylish mumbo jumbo scare film . it creeps along at a gruelingly slow pace , belaboring its point that ghosts can live among the living . but time seems irrelevant here , as it could be set at any time , though the story fits most readily into the victorian period . the house is not only creepy and filled with ghost sounds , but is enveloped in darkness because all the windows must be covered with thick curtains as the children are mysteriously allergic to the light and if exposed it could be fatal to them . there are 50 doors , 15 keys , and enough dark corners and creaky floorboards to even scare a dead person . when those clich ? d scary formula effects don't work enough scares , the background music goes into a high crescendo to add more chills . it's a scary movie because it takes on a number of different themes ; such as , madness , ghosts haunting a house , religious dogma , sexual repressions , and hysteria . the film was heading in the right direction until the surprise ending left me less pleased with it . the striking performance by ms . kidman , who carries this pic , and the feeling of loneliness it had established , make it a film that has much to recommend it despite its shortcomings .
rating:1 a disturbing drama , inspired by a true story , that rails against the hypocritical sexual attitudes of the times . the first-time filmmaker , philip goodhew , takes us behind the nice lace curtains of a respectable british household and brings us a story of repression , jealousy , and obsession . it's a well-made but grimly unmoving film , that dwells on an unpleasant subject , that culminates in a gruesome double homicide . in this rather peculiar m ? nage ? trois , harold is not only stuck with mum but has to ward off joyce . it's my birthday ! " by the climax , it becomes apparent that this affair is no laughing matter . but the film somehow couldn't get past its laughter at these absurd characters and it failed to provide some pathos to go with the dramatics . there was just a growing emptiness that seemed to hang over it , which prevented me from seeing this as just your typical bizarre crime story .
rating:2 it is artfully directed by leconte , with his choppy camera work matching the mediterranean's bubbly sea movements and the trembling nature of the feature players , plus his smoothly dark photography makes it seem as if he's filming a 1940s noir work , and his eclectic musical background soundtracks ( ranging from benny goodman to marianne faithfull and from italian to turkish music ) adds an excitement to a story that changes moods from comical to tragical at the drop of a knife . it should be noted , in the director's biggest joke he has with the audience , how the background music plays a large part in the enjoyment of the film . when the film is playful and lighthearted , it is sublime and masterfully done . unfortunately , when the last reel comes , the film shifts gears and starts to take its philosophical musings about chance and luck seriously , and the film becomes contrived and loses much of its punch . the power in the film's punch comes mostly from the imaginative performances of international pop star vanessa paradis , the girlfriend of johnny depp , and from one of france's most popular and best actors , daniel auteuil . these two have an electricity together that is , indeed , magical , with both featuring very expressive facial gestures and large eyes that open wider when welcoming the viewer into their story in a most hospitable way . perhaps any film with subtitles ( especially subtitles that are hard to read ) and one that is shot in black-and-white , can only be relegated to a select audience . or , maybe , a knife-thrower act in a circus venue is art in america , while in paris it might be viewed as the old -- seen that , done that thing . she is so persuasive , that we know everything about her that we have to from this brief opening look at her , so much so that when she shifts her eyes , we even know what she is thinking . now that's the start of a lifetime friendship , if you ask me . there was something bizarre about the act that was movie magic . . . fake magic , i grant you , but magical enough to keep me glued to my seat in anticipation of what will happen to her , as leconte also had the circus sideshow entourage gasping with concern . i think he might even have expected the theater viewer to be masturbating over this . my favorite tryst , was her and the contorsionnist making it on top of the piano ( the sex act itself is only imagined and is tastefully not seen -- but can you imagine how they did it ? ) . the film then moves off the map of credible filmmaking and becomes silly and contrived , probably imitative of those cartoonish-like action films , where there is a daring helicopter rescue of the couple adrift at sea . for a film that was so sublime and had such an enchanting mystical romance going for it , it foolishly throws that all away to make its cheap points about chance and to show how if two souls that fit together like two halves of a money bill , will only have value if it does not get torn apart , which is too heavy-handed a message for this bubbly film to handle . the film should have been a more far-reaching one and it could have been much funnier if it didn't go on the wrong cruise toward the end . but what we have is still a visually spellbinding film and one where vanessa and danny prove to be very human creatures , who are worth caring about . what i still came up with , is that they are both good at flirting with disaster , but what they both have in spades , is a whimsical sense of humor and a strange sense of survival , and just like serge frydman's script , which was both witty and superfluous , the film nevertheless succeeded in sucking me into its story , a story which probably implied more about it than it actually delivered . but , despite this and that about it that seemed to me as if it was drifting off into the territory of play acting , i still thought it was a smart film .
rating:1 raul ruiz , the chilean-born , france-based director of one hundred films so far , who has been noted for his offbeat features and ambiguous works , has made this american mainstream film in english that has all his pet themes intact . for a ruiz film , this one is about as accessible as he gets . if you ever wanted to know how it might feel for a person who is losing their marbles , this film might be able to shed some light on that . it is a tantalizing thriller that offers the viewer a chance to see if they can separate fantasy from reality . ruiz's films always seem to be about the multiple identities of characters who might just be figments of one's imagination or might be about someone who is leading a parallel life . shattered image has its two stars struggle through some very awkward dialogue and plot twists that keep coming unmercifully at the viewer . ruiz's experimental film style opts for the most he can get out of his stylized settings , confusing but beautiful camera shots , and all the kitsch he can muster in every mise-en-sc ? ne . but she can't determine what he looks like . the film's ending is as blurred as jessies' intermingled dreams are ; but , at least , the climax returns to the beginning of the film to try and clear things up in the usual unhelpful way ruiz solves his mysteries . if you enjoy this kind of pseudo intellectual puzzler , then you must be prepared to be kept in suspense , not knowing more about the character than what ruiz wanted revealed .
rating:1 a crisp james cagney comedy vehicle , at a time when the 34-year-old actor was at the peak of his stardom . the film plays like a spoof on hollywood and on cagney's previous roles in gangster films as a tough-guy for warner bros . , and the result is a very funny film . the inside joke about the strand , is that's the cinema where warner bros . showed all their film openings in the 1930s , including where lady killer opened . the two seem to have a good chemistry working together . a breezy feature , showing cagney in his true light during the depression era of escapist films . it was in films like this one that gave his audience hope things no matter how ridiculous they seemed for them , could get better . this is strictly a star-vehicle film and one that is well-suited for cagney's talents .
rating:1 this one is set in modern la and filled with pointless violence , and with nothing relevant to say about its dirty cop subject matter . it would have been just another entertaining film that was eye-catching , amusing , and filled with non-stop action but for the last fifteen minutes , when the film fell apart and came up with a very unsound ending and ruined any chance for it to be appreciated in an artistic sense--even for denzel washington's fine performance . the way it ended made no sense , as this smorgasbord in violence had gangs of blacks , mexicans , and even russians , interact with corrupt city law enforcers . for denzel , this is a chance for him to show off how he could be cast against type as the heavy and still be charismatic . if anything , this pic shows that he's up to being a baddie . he's also up to the physical nature of the role as he gives a muscular performance , and he is able to talk the street-talk with the best of them . it becomes apparent that alonzo doesn't follow the book , as he plays mind games with jake and plants the seeds that you either do things my way or it's back to hum-drum police work with no promotions in sight . it was just too much slime to take in for one day , as somewhere after the first half of the film the shock scenes simply wore off and the film lost any dramatic effect ; it just looked cartoonish . but the twists in plot kept coming , and it took us down a seedier and more improbable path . it seemed likely that jake would have gotten off this crooked job offer faster , if this film had wanted to achieve anything resembling reality . the aim was obviously not realism , but to take the story into its own interpretation of the corruption in the lapd which was recently in the news . but the film's major failure is to go anywhere with this material and say anything that was revealing . all the shootouts seemed glossy but the final one seemed totally out of place , of the russian mafia going into action . it left the film to be hung out to dry as just another forgettable exploitation film , even though it was well-acted .
rating:2 this is a well crafted sci-fi film from the 1950s , that became a cult favorite and helped generate interest in the sci-fi film as a popular genre . it had a well-intentioned liberal message in the face of the time's mccarthy witch hunts , it only lacked an edge to its straightforward rational call for world peace and an end to the nuclear arms race . this intelligent and humanitarian film plays like a christian allegory . klaatu even uses the alias mr . carpenter , an obvious reference to christ . lock martin played gort . bernard herrmann's brilliantly haunting musical score aided in capturing the alien atmosphere of the story . it's hard to argue with the rational message delivered , i just wished the film took on the politics of the scientists sleeping in the same bed with the government , who are just as much a detriment to world peace as the xenophobic media and the cowardly bunch of world leaders .
rating:2 a neat noir thriller that has a slight variation on the " double indemnity " theme , this time it is the guy who is the seducer . dalton trumbo , the blacklisted writer , is the uncredited cowriter of the script . his trademark signal at the end of his show is , " i'll be seeing you susan . " this is particularly annoying for webb , as he calls his voice oily . as for the contemptuous van heflin , who really has a disregard for others , his love for keyes was real but not enough for him , he had to also have the superficial material things of life to satisfy his weak ego . these two stars gave superb performances in this arresting thriller that is scripted with a social conscience and a taut sense of reality .
rating:2 writer-director/acting star-artist , takashi kitano , has broken ground from traditional films , taking risks that defy explaining how to classify this very violent and tender film , that sways between the two extremes , and as the critic joel hoberman so astutely states , fireworks is a cross between ozu's late spring and don siegel's dirty harry . kitano is not noted for plot development and for understanding women . his forte is in the raw nerve of his films and the stark beauty of the cinematography . one should expect the unexpected from his films . the violence is brutal and fast-paced . the narrative is told in flashbacks , so any part of nishi's life could pop up on the screen , and what would seem like a commonplace crime story unfolding , deceptively turns out to be much more than that , even as nishi gets revenge on the yakuma's who did this to his friend , unafraid of bringing untold graphic violence to the screen . you better believe that caught my attention . but , if that was all this film was about , the dirty harry description of the film would have been completely apropos . this highly original film , that is at times a masterpiece and other times a grade b- movie , is difficult for me to penetrate what it all means as far as a commentary on japanese culture , but the japanese critics have been critical of his attacks on japanese conformity , while the japanese public accepts him as a popular performer and stage comedian , even if his films have not been as well received in japan as they have been in foreign countries . as far as i am concerned , i prefer ozu , i am more taken with his intellect and perspective , but i can appreciate the artistic direction kitano is taking his violent subject matter to , as i found this volatile film to be something special , but something i can't completely comprehend because i don't really know what he is trying to say , as if that really matters . yet his film is a visual treat to behold , and for that i am grateful and accepting of his work .
rating:2 a very good chan film . it has a spooky atmosphere , a lot of plot twists , a fast-pace , and is fun to watch . there are many characters ( though there are too many to develop anything about them ) , many suspects , and there is a daffiness about this episode that is endearing . if you disregard all the holes in the story , then you should find this one to be a refreshing thriller .
rating:1 this biting family drama hones in on the anxieties and turbulence a dysfunctional modern french family experiences , eventually uncovering all their unhappiness , but not much else is offered as for plot surprises . jean-pierre darroussin , the self-effacing waiter , denis , was reading during the show . film student , who has a knack for making wry observations regarding relationships . this realistic film is based on a play written by two of the actors here , ms . jaoui and jean-pierre bacri . in fact , this entire ensemble cast also acted in the play . she explains henri's dour disposition and lack of ambition away , with the ridiculous comment that she knew he would amount to nothing because he was a late walker . all this becomes tedious after awhile , though i'm sure it accurately portrays how some bourgeoisie families are . what i was waiting to see happen , was something momentous or inspiring , but that never really occurred . instead , what happened was that this drama went on cruise control , with a functional dialogue and characters who really did seem to resemble each other after awhile . the basic plot revolved around the problems the children have . nonetheless , this was a somewhat satisfying if not too sobering of a film experience . it really is a film that can't stop being a play , and to its detriment it can't do anything to alter that structure . it is through small changes in character development that the film succeeds best . and isn't that the way it is in real life ? this claustrophobic production , done in real time over the course of one evening , understands that . it did offer one scene , in particular , that caught my fancy . when yo-yo was given her birthday presents , it was fun to see who gave her what . this was the funniest moment in the film , and it did seem to give the characters renewed wind to charge into its final moments . the film's bleakness was somewhat lessened when we see the bookish denis and the outspoken betty riding off together on a motor scooter , hopefully to live together happily ever after . as the simple yo-yo commented on seeing that friendship , she's lucky to have such a nice guy . it seems everyone but the snobbishly recalcitrant and ever nagging mother learned a little something this evening about themselves .
rating:1 a film noir that is more a character study of a small-time jewel thief than one concerned with its pulp story . the artistic shots are like those that orson welles did in " the lady from shanghai . " the film succeeds as a visual feast in noir photography , which includes shadowy framed scenes and close-ups of the characters sweating during the heist . the film's weaknesses lie in the slight story and how it came at the end of the film noir cycle , so all the artistry of the noir devices seemed to be beaten to the ground by now .
rating:3 a splendidly chilling noir tale about murder , immorality , lust , and greed . the three stars are all magnificent . the director , billy wilder , an austrian ? migr ? , is in top form , as this film was made before he became too leery of hollywood and became more cynical than hard-boiled . it was wilder himself who made the script so taut , relying on the drunken chandler for limited support , as he was too inebriated to work on the script but very skilled in making the dialogue sparkle . the result of wilder's efforts to streamline the story and keep it obsessive , is a film that can make you sweat . its dark and moody cinematography is brilliantly shot by john seitz , setting up the hypnotic rhythmical flow of the story , as narrated by macmurray's noir-like voiceover . if all that wasn't enough to make this one of the best noir films ever , add on the odd attraction the two killers have for each other and the genuine relationship between the macmurray and robinson characters , which is almost father and son like , plus you got a film that perfectly captures the dark atmosphere of the prewar los angeles scene . i didn't get the money . and i didn't get the woman . '' while she seems to be without a heart , a cold and bitter femme fatale , who , at first look , seems to be at blame for what transpired . but , on another look , it seems as if chance played a great part in the tragedy that was to happen , as the two combustible personalities were alike more than what they at first realized , and their chance encounter set everything in motion . they will carry off a murder that they probably wouldn't have done if they just thought about what they were doing and what they really wanted . there is a genuine love between them , but they are both too caught up in portraying the hardened men they want to appear as , than to recognize their very tender needs . it would have been a perfect crime , but then too many questions kept popping up . this interest in lola is refreshing for him , he finds that he would rather be with her than with phyllis . i'm rotten to the heart . i used you , just as you said . that's all you ever meant to me . until a minute ago , when i couldn't fire that second shot . " neff a running gag throughout the film , is that neff continually lights the cigars of the " matchless " keyes . as wilder's perverse sense of humor , supports the film's grim conclusion , that both phyllis and neff were not criminals in the real sense of being criminals , but were weak-minded individuals , unhappy with their lives , who succumbed to their human failings . wilder's original ending of having neff die in the gas chamber was scrubbed by him as being unnecessary , so we'll never know if that ending was more powerful than the present one . wilder told an interviewer that neff's death was among " two of the best scenes i've ever shot in my whole life " ( the other being the sunset boulevard opening ) . what this ending left was a question mark , as i wondered why neff returns to the office to confess to keyes , if what he really wanted to do was to escape . take note of their last comments : " you know why you couldn't figure this one , keyes ? i'll tell you . because the guy you were looking for was too close--right across the desk from you . '' keyes says , " closer than that , walter , '' and then neff says , ``i love you , too . ''
rating:1 this is not the way the american dream is meant to be earned . it can only be attained by the honest means of hard work and fair play and through one's ability . kruger also has the best line in the film , when he tells chippy , " i admire loyalty , but not to the wrong people . "
rating:2 in it he questions american values , suggesting that it is better to lose and be a nice person than to win and stand for nothing but your own self-aggrandizement . she becomes the easily recognizable villain in payne's satire of american society . makes harelik's love for her seem highly improbable . paul is one of those rich kids who is very nice and very popular , but who is not a very sophisticated or manipulative person . in some ways , this film reminded me of two diverse recent films i saw , welcome to the dollhouse and rushmore . they all had an anger to them , pointing at something in society that is not all that it appears to be and saying that is where the problem lies . in this screenplay , by payne and jim taylor , it has accurately captured a certain look and feel high school has about it . this film was able to show how its school was not conducive for the individual to feel free in . that all the characters are flawed , unable to see beyond the very narrow limits they operate under has made for a very trying tale . the film just didn't know how to end its story by landing on its feet . it had a great performance by matthew broderick , who was subtle and obvious enough to bring out the inner and outer conflicts in his life . yet , the main problem remaining is that aside from the flaws of all the characters involved , there is no one else to blame for the moral dilemma that is presented .
rating:3 the film's theme is about how women are made to suffer in iran because of its harsh islamic laws against them , which makes all of their lives placed in the same never ending circle of repression . which is why the film has no main protagonist ; the cast , except for fereshteh sadr orafai and fatemeh naghavi , are all nonprofessionals . jafar panahi ( white balloon/the mirror ) , a disciple of abbas kiarostami , has created a devastatingly restrained powerhouse of a political film . a winner of the golden lion at the venice film festival , even though it has been banned in iran except for a one-time screening to a small student audience . a woman's life is shown to be not as worthy as a man's in modern iran , as the story of one woman is carried on as the story of another woman's . the enemy obviously isn't the iranian people , but an intolerant government that cannot bend and forces its stupid rules down a subjected peoples' throats . this film conveys these dark feelings through a story without much of a plot or dialogue , yet brilliantly establishes the yearnings for freedom that these women have . it's much like those warner brother films of the 1930s with jimmy cagney thumbing his nose at the high brows . panafi has taken us into the psyche of the oppressive regime and without saying what's right or wrong , allows us instead to see for ourselves the everyday street life of modern iran . it's a country far from freedom , yet its filmmakers can still make a film that is unpredictable and forthright . this is something that's rarely accomplished in uncensored hollywood whose commercial ventures are mostly formulaic crowd pleaser films . these are amazing restrictions placed on them and ones that panafi allows us to see in an exciting and unforgettable way . it's a moody , realistic tale about iran that the news media can't seem to cover with a reasonable verisimilitude as well as this very daring effort does . it succeeds in showing us as much as one can in today's iran about its long laundry list of injustices . this is one film that cannot easily be forgotten , even as we lose sight of the different women we have seen . all the performances were natural and easily fit into the story . the facial expressions of both orfani and mamizade caught my attention : orfani's had that caring , intense look of the italian actress anna magnani ; while mamizade's expression changed from curiosity to vulnerability .
rating:2 all the country's money was needed to rebuilt , as movies seemed a frivolous activity at the time . rossellini used poor film stock leftover from the fascists and filmed despite all the technical deficiencies he ran into , and came up with a gritty , authentic looking film for his grim story of survival and fight for freedom . this was a breakthrough film for the director , whose neorealism style , using a hollywood type of narrative and a documentary style approach to filming , caught the dire mood of the resistance movement and the ordinary people who fought the fascists . awards such as the new york film critics circle and best film in cannes in 1946 , came to this film . it awakened an international audience to the knowledge that italian cinema was well and roberto rossellini was a director to be reckoned with , along with de sica , who just filmed " shoe shine " in the neorealism style , also , to international acclaim . the film has an immediacy about it , but it also seemed overly melodramatic at times , relying so much on the premise , that by being as good as the germans , the italians , the slave-race , can prove that there was no need for the war since there is no such thing as a master race . that manfredi dies without talking after being tortured , makes his heroics larger than anyone else's , and proves that the italians are every bit as good as the germans . rossellini hoped to examine the italian soul and show that there were both good and bad people among them , while the german's have gone so far off the edge of sanity , that it is hard to find a good german because of their perverse beliefs . anna magnani gives the film credibility through her humanity , as her story is filled with her heartfelt yearnings . the other professional actor among all the nonprofessionals to standout , was the priest role as warmly played by aldo fabrizi , who elicited a call for sensibility and caring for people . though , the film does not seem as relevant as it was when first released and acclaimed as a masterpiece , having lost some of its purity , nevertheless , it still retains its moral high ground and its ability to show the collective will of the people , who resisted being oppressed . it is still a work of considerable merit .
rating:2 and that's the gist of the plot for this sophisticated and superbly acted romance story , that turns the tables on the old notion that the man controls the destiny of the household . because of the expressiveness and raw emotions of the stars , as they go through all kinds of mood swings and power plays until they resolve this very ticklish and perplexing problem they face , we are confronted with a situation whereas pierre has done nothing ghastly to ruin the marriage and the couple still profess a love for each other , yet they are undergoing a separation . his quiet manner , hurt expression , and look of bewilderment says it all . " in a couple , one suffers and the other one's bored , and vice versa . " it now becomes a question if they can weather this storm and the bitterness that is so much a part of their love . a pivotal scene is when the verbal fighting , accusations and hitting take place , that was really unexpected from this urbane couple , except we see it building up and festering inside the stricken pierre . the director wisely doesn't give us too much information about her lover or the details of their love life . that more or less sums up the direction the director was going with this one , by trying to explain the imponderable reason for the snag in their marriage due to a lack of communication . this is an intelligent film , told from the point of view of the man , though this film is not as powerful as paul cox's similar type of film " my first wife . " its huge plus , however , is that it avoids the use of cliches usually reserved for explaining why a couple is breaking up and plays up the small petty things in a relationship that strain one's nerves . this marriage-go-round leaves us off in familiar territory . most of us know how it feels to be unsure of someone we love . and it stings . this work is a testament to a confused couple who are sensible enough to face things that are unpleasant to them in a forthright manner without covering it up . it is only the real good directors , as evidently christian vincent is , who can pull off such an imbroglio with everything turning out to be in a daze for them ; but , nevertheless , ending up intact .
rating:1 it questions the military leader's decision not to even fire a shot , though outmanned and sure to be defeated , but offering no resistance or support to their countrymen . that seemed hard to believe , considering they had an armed force of some three thousand . the result is a straightforward , old-fashioned drama that shows his mettle and crustiness , in a film noted solely for his sterling performance . the film ably depicts the peaceful nature of the norwegian people and how they found war to be a very difficult position for them to be in , and how confused everyone was at the time , as there was a lack of leadership from the top . there is mass confusion and no strong leadership present there . but that doesn't stop the men from laughing at thor , who is dressed in his outdated uniform and is so much older than anyone else at headquarters . the last lieutenant doesn't have anything new to say , but what it says about one's loyalty to country and how its military leaders were faced with difficult decisions , was deftly handled by first-time director hans petter moland . it is a film for those who want to see a different approach to war films , one where the study of character is more important than the battle scenes and the arguments of ideology . the film told a decent story . it's only problem was , that it just wasn't that exciting a picture .
rating:1 anthony mann is a master at directing these cheapie films and making them look stylish . he gets the most out of this thin story because of the complementary performances of raymond burr and steve brodie . violence and desperation are the themes of this noir film . if examined closely , there are many holes in the story , but what works very effectively is how the film shows that middle-class aspirations for the postwar period are tinged with cynicism . it's shown how there's a sense of brutality that fills the everyday american social scene . the paranoid couple feels the urgency to look out for themselves , not trusting anyone else to help them . this feeling of hopelessness the couple has , gives this film its classic noir look .
rating:3 " the thing " was long suspected of being directed by howard hawks--much later on this was confirmed by the actors . this is one of the better science-fiction cheapie films , one that became a cult classic . it is a wonderfully banal film about a flying saucer landing on the north pole and a superior alien , who looks like frankenstein , being thawed out . hawks wastes no time with any liberal messages about why this creature came here , instead the film has a jovial air force crew snappily banter at each other , a sparring romantic relationship develop between the womanizing captain and the scientist's independent-minded secretary cut through the fierceness of the monster story , and for quirkiness , we see plants as monsters crying for more blood to spawn more monsters . the cast is perfect , their non-chalant attitude gives the film its raucous mood and allows the warlike atmosphere between beast and man to be a battle of both wits and brawn . but the air force is only interested in the safety of everyone concerned and see no redeeming value in communicating with the alien . nikki snaps back , " you boil it . " then , as an ironic twist , the monster cuts off the heat in the building . but carrington has gone crazy , clammoring " i want to understand it , " and has shut off the generator . the film closes with the excited scottie breaking the story to the world , screaming into the microphone : " i bring a warning--to every one of you listening to the sound of my voice . tell the world , tell this to everyone wherever they are : watch the skies , watch everywhere , keep looking--watch the skies ! this is a fast-paced and enjoyable b-film , giving us a feel for the cold war paranoia taking hold of the country at the time . it is about how anyone different is viewed as an enemy , and how there is a sense of isolation for intellectuals in the country .
rating:2 and , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line . in the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . the scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david's view but coming at it from a much different angle . it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . that the director's point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters . what can one expect out of life ? the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don't like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene .
rating:2 shot almost entirely on digital video with a hand-held camera , miguel arteta's ( star maps ) chuck and buck is an arresting homo-erotic tale about the pangs of growing up while still stuck emotionally at an adolescent stage . these scenes are the heart of the film , as they bring out whatever brilliance there is to be found in the characterizerations , depicting in an honest way how those who are not destined to live a conventional life behave with each other in a natural setting . the film allowed the supporting characters to interact with each other , not going for the cheap comedy it could have gone after by just making fun of buck's tortured character . this makes the supporting characters not that much different than buck as to their feelings of insecurity . a gnawing flaw to this film is that it hits a dead spot , which comes after the play is presented . the thinly disguised autobiographical play , embarrasses chuck . the film seemed to run out of steam at that point , having exhausted itself of its underlying probe into the tormented soul of buck , who is seen more as a pathetic figure who is desperately in need of being touched , someone who does not possess the social skills to relate with others . the film takes a few deep breathes and returns for a discerning conclusion , which was thoroughly credible and well-presented . a tremendous effort by the indie film-makers is realized to tell a moving character study , thereby achieving such a high-quality film on such a low-budget , as it daringly rests its unsentimental case on such a thin plot and succeeds because its characterizations came to life and the effort to look at friendship and human behavior was an honest one . it is also a disarmingly funny movie .
rating:0 it's an old-fashioned type of film , that has the main characters talking in phony polish accents and throwing out schmaltzy dialogue at will , as it suffers so much from being poorly scripted . there must have been a reason why neophyte director/writer theresa connelly made this film into a nostalgia story that wants to look like it was made in the 1950s , i just wish she included that reason as part of the storytelling and dropped all those clich ? s to explain every situation . in the realm of movies that try so hard to please its audience , this one almost begs for audience approval , but the only thing that should please the crowd is the sex appeal of the beautiful looking ensemble cast . i'm sure there could have been some comedy over this , but the film was so flat , it couldn't draw out the comedy or any worthwhile observation about this zany situation . it didn't work for me , i got no warm and fuzzy feeling for this working-class family . it was a film of many vignettes , all coming together with the themes of family values , sex , and religion , but none of the themes is brought to any fruition where it could register with any credibility .
rating:1 a minor noir film , originally made for radio . vince tells him i grew up with you , we took a lot of raps together , and then you turned stool pigeon on me , turning state evidence on me so that you could beat the rap , making me serve a two year sentence for manslaughter . " i should call dr . kemble ! " but kemble is not available . the film's finale is done in grand noir-style , filmed in a santa monica warehouse , where one of vince's flunkies , petey , played by the rotund , minuscule veteran character actor with the high-pitched squeaky voice , percy helton , my all-time favorite bit player , who must have had thousands of uncredited parts in a variety of films . what distinguishes this film as not the normal crime-type of film , with a happy ending , but as a noir-work , is how it captures the changing societal attititudes of the protagonists , who desperately want to fit into postwar american society despite their prior misdeeds . this is seen mainly through the dark los angeles settings depicted by the camerawork of probably the best noir cinematographer ever , john alton , and not through the thin plot structure of the film . what leaves a lasting impression on the viewer , is the warehouse shootout , as we see these antisocial types trapped like rats and how they react . it all seems credible because john payne has the look of someone who has just come out of a laundry washing machine and is now being hung out to dry .
rating:1 tango is a romantic musical , supposedly influenced by fellini's 8 1/2 , with political overtones to its otherwise almost mirthful mood , that is , for a saura film . saura accomplishes his musical numbers with a rather terse storyline , which means that if you don't care for the tango , you could find yourself bored with this slow-moving story . what is exceptional about this film , is how superbly choreographed and stunningly colorful and visionary a spectacle it is , as its cinematographer is the great vittorio storaro ( last tango in paris ) . one of the tango masters , explains to us that the tango is excellently done when experienced dancers can perform it , so there is one body and four legs in motion . there is lots of innovative dancing and , by mario , there is lots of deep brooding thought about life and what must go into the film to make it arty . we see see a wind machine and the next thing we see is a sultry tango being performed , sets are designed out of seemingly thin air , there are color filters for dance numbers created on the spot , a west side story look alike number is shown with all male dancers . the dancing is good enough to carry this film alone . but the story , that's another story , it just didn't seem that important , including the nebulous surprise ending , which in actuality , detracted even further from the slight storyline . the mood the musical numbers set was so convincingly dreamlike , that for someone like me , who was born with two left feet , i felt like going to a ballroom and trying this elegant dance , even if i never danced the tango before . the dancing remains in my head , and that is what cinema can do to you when it is so stunning to behold .
rating:2 though kitano has strong feelings for them , probably reminded through them of his own unsteady youth , he nevertheless doesn't let them off the hook , showing their many faults and blemishes , and their immaturity and lack of discipline that is needed to succeed . this is one of the better boxing/troubled teenager movies i have seen , very much in the style of those old warner brothers bogie films . there is a freshness and a spark in it that is very easy to feel . these were characters placed in situations where they are still so young , that their current downfall does not necessarily mean curtains for them . kitano continues to make offbeat films that are packed with a wallop . this film has his same intense rhythms and visuals as his other great gangster films , but it is less violently graphic . the director is so confidant of what he is doing that the character of shinji shines ever so strongly , despite long periods of him remaining quiet . kitano's unique gift is in his understanding of the troubled youths and in his humorous presentation of them , one that is given with a gently bemused but forgiving look at how the teens do such stupid things as kids . a most interesting and perceptive film .
rating:1 a gritty , realistic look at life in the black ghetto . the film is flawed by the obviousness of the situation it shows , yet despite these flaws there is a power in seeing how real these people are . there was no new ground broken , but it did hit a nerve as to what life in a housing project looks like . the film has a powerful opening , which sets the stage for its tragic tale . the film works because it had an honest energy to it , though when it tries to say something meaningful it feels like so much jive . the triteness and predictability of the story prevents the film from traveling too far from the reality of the housing projects the filmmaker knows . the film can't penetrate any further than some surface responses . it's a cautionary inner-city film that should well serve the youthful urban audience that will be most attracted to its story and should relate to them better than it would to a wide audience .
rating:3 a top-notch film noir about the loneliness and despair in tinseltown , which is more a weighty drama story than a murder mystery . dix's idea of knowing you are in love is making breakfast for his girl , hardly a poetical romantic notion but more of the notion of love the common man might have . it's the kind of temperament that could swing across the pendulum from a loving warmth to an insane rage . dix is not a very pleasant noir character ; he's someone trapped in his dark emotions , left in a lonely place where he can't work out his problems and can only be viewed as someone who is too alienated to make positive relationships . i died when she left me . i lived a few weeks while she loved me . "
rating:3 stanley kubrick's first big financed a film and first film with a major hollywood star . kirk douglas who liked the script , thinking it would give him a chance to work on a quality film with a strong social message , thereby getting his production company to back it . this antiwar film , one of the best ever made , much like renoir's masterpiece " the grand illusion , " does a great job of criticizing the role of the french military higher-ups in ww1 . the movie turns most of its attention to the action taking place in a military courtroom court-martial and the interplay between the officer's political manuevering for power . kubrick's masterpiece was more cynical and gritty than renoir's very poetic and humane indictment of war . one reason why this was so , was because it hit harder at those who were its subjects and as a result many country's reacted so vehemently as to officially oppose the film . it should also be pointed out , that the ambitious kubrick rewrote the original script to give the film a more traditional hollywood upbeat ending to it , much to kirk douglas's surprise and disapproval . kubrick , reportedly , wanted the film to be a box office success and was willing to forgo artistic integrity . the controversial ending might be termed a cop-out by many , while others found its sentimentalities quite appropriate and cynical enough . incidentally , in my opinion , the major flaw in paths of glory wasn't the taut script , which was lucid and hard-hitting , but it was in kirk douglas's egomaniacal performance ( though a strong performance and the best one in kirk's career ) . but , as forceful and necessary as kirk's performance was , it still allowed the film to become centered around him , rather than on the universality of the story unfolding in its very natural and engrossing way about the horrors , evils , and insanity of war . kubrick aimed for a critique both of war and of class systems . he accomplished this by pessimistically and cynically showing how the privilege class cares only about themselves and how its power is corrupting . we are told that world war i has dragged on for two years and that it became a stalemate of fortified trenches and heavy casualties . war but then broulard says that a promotion awaits , there will be consideration for another star . after dax says it is not possible to do , mireau says , " show me a patriot and i'll show you an honest man . " but mireau , not to be undone in the generosity of the moment , says let's make it 3 and have the 701st's three commanding officers choose one from each outfit . broulard says we better get a court-martial for them and make it legal . angrily , dax turns him down , as broulard looks at him incredulously , as if he were a fool , saying you really cared about saving those three men , you are an idealist . dax tells him to give the men a few minutes . the film is direct and powerful . it wouldn't have been banned for so long if it didn't hit home with its hard message . it is magnificently shot , as the trenches are frighteningly real and incomprehensible to understand until seen . kirk douglas is overwhelming in his stabilizing role , in my opinion too much so . but , nevertheless , his anger is warranted , as he is the emotional glue that holds the film together and gives humanity some measure for hope . though i came away from the film feeling no hope . i was cynical of everyone's motives , including dax's . to call him a hero , as the ending of the film implies by its crass sentimentality , as it shows him going back to the front , left me cold . adolphe menjou and george macready came through with outstanding performances , each one an incarnation of machiavellian evil . when on screen , their performances are like machine gun fire directed at you . there is much to chew on idea-wise , despite how simple the film might appear on first viewing it , and thereby lies its true greatness , as it seems to make a timeless argument against war ; and , as in most kubrick films , it is not dated , in fact , it seems to get better with age .
rating:1 all she can say is , that she needs my help because she is weak . she learns that others think her do-gooder nature causes more harm to others than good , that if she can't help in a positive way she should step aside and let the other person fend for themselves ; that she does this because she is a self-indulgent person . the acting was convincing , but the story didn't have enough suspense in it to sustain interest , especially when the ending was becoming increasingly predictable , as the story wore on . what interested me in a rather oblique way , was how tired life in poland seemed , and how the real enemy seemed to be the bureaucratic nature of the country , that was off-handedly touched upon in the scenes at work , as the love triangle waned in my interest . i thought of how different things were in america during that time frame of the '70s , and how similar bureaucracies seem to be wherever they exist , whatever the time frame is .
rating:2 the b/w film starts off fast-paced and never stops to catch its breath . this comes about after there is an actual lineup in the film , as all the ship's porters are brought in so that dressler could identify the one who threw his luggage in the cab . but since the rather snooty dressler was not observant of these lower-class types , he was unable to pick the porter out of the lineup . these two psychopaths are real beauties , and give the film the kind of quirkiness that keeps its brutal scenes counterbalanced with a nice edge of verbal nastiness . warner's last words , duly noted for julian's benefit are , " why be greedy ? " this film is not noteworthy for its sadistic story , but what makes it rise above the ordinary b movie , is the strangely provocative dialogue and the utter depravity of all the criminals , who are shown in all their ugliness and unredeeming features . the outcome shows that they can't rise to another social level despite all their efforts to polish dancer's image .
rating:1 a poignant melodrama about the side effects of battle-fatigue lingering after ww11 . it is a finely acted and well produced film , but the story itself is not that involving . i found its build-up to the climax , where secrets would be bared about how meeker got to be the way he was , not worth the wait in finding out . what the film did well was show that after the war many americans thirsted for a better standard of life and thought they could get it in the suburbs . meeker was particularly effective in being a sympathetic figure , craving for affection and love , in this low-key human interest story .
rating:0 i should have been so lucky to have been gone from the theater in 60 seconds ; but , i sat through this two hour remake of the slender film " gone " ( 1974 ) , an original film that was so shallow , everything else seen that year must have seemed deep by comparison . it's hard to get lower in moral decrepitude than this car current booster film . this was not only a bad film but a particularly annoying one . this is a jerry bruckheimer productions , which has come to stand for mediocrity in artistic value but for success in the box office , which will probably mirror how this film does , though it is a little worst artistically speaking than his other mediocre films , as if that will supposedly matter to its target audience . to make up for not coming prepared with a script that made sense , a stellar cast was hired but then was asked to do nothing , instead some gorgeous vintage cars were put on display and each was given a girl's name . everything about the story was kept hyper , as mindless violence won out over gratuitous sex , to become the major selling point of this exploitive film . the action begins right from the opening credits . the thrill of the film now becomes in watching the crew be selected , which includes angelina jolie , chi mcbride , james duval , and scott caan , none of whom are in the least bit interesting or funny . jolie seems to disappear for most of the film , only to reappear much later in the film and mumble a few inconsequential lines . there's basically no story or dialogue , the action is all packaged like commercials are with gloss and trick shots , colored filters , fast-paced editing , and all the other tricks of the trade the directors for jerry bruckheimer use to sell the action sequences . everything about this film seemed ridiculous . its logic for being could be taken apart at any point of the film . the moral bankruptcy it presented , that lindo would just let cage and his crew off the hook for all the thefts , was too much to comprehend . it was so weak to hear lindo say to cage , " well , you saved my life , and i guess it was a brotherly thing you did for your brother , so i'm going to let you go , now get out of here before i change my mind . " if i had my wish , lindo should go to jail for failing to do his job . the director should go to work in duvall's body shop and never direct another film . and , this senseless macho film should die a slow death at the box office , so films like this would become extinct like dinosaurs . i should be so lucky . . .
rating:1 the set is bristling with problems and tension . while the topical story is about the business and cynicism involved in making a picture , and the vanity of those in the field , its deeper concern is with understanding the personal nature of failure , insecurity , and disappointment . the film borders on soap opera but manages to get beyond it because of the intelligent discretion of minnelli in his directing and the fine acting from the two male leads , with robinson's performance being nothing short of brilliant , enough to lift this film on his shoulders alone to a loftier dimension .
rating:1 a stunningly original film , but one that is hardly plausible . yes . it is entertaining to a certain degree . the terror seemed more theatrical than real inner angst , which took away from the film's tense scenes . the film's theme , a recurring one in filmmaker cronenberg's repertoire -- of an unhappy body in a palace revolt -- suggests in no uncertain terms that dreams can kill . . . and that anger if unchecked is something that takes its toll on the individual and on others . this transference method is called " psychoplasmics . " the story proceeds on an erratic course of mixing gore and shock with cerebral challenges , never establishing which one it is more commmitted to , as the story moves too far adrift to maintain a credible suspense . instead it relies on the intense performance of oliver reed , as the so-called genius experimenter who lost track of right and wrong , to pull you into the politics of what the film is saying about ethical medicine and the implications it has for the patients and society . i say . . . there's it's a film that could easily be viewed as being about a bad marriage and an even uglier separation , in other words a domestic drama with the trappings of a horror film . while throwing out a lot of nauseating sights and many themes , the film failed to hold together to make this a solid effort , but if viewed for its parts rather than its sum , it had some very strong scenes of relating one's body problems to the constraints of the mind . in any case , it's more cerebral than the usual special-effect horror film and is worth seeing for its uniqueness .
rating:2 this is a film where the heroine could say with deep conviction that " i've seen bodies shining like stars , " and we believe her without laughing at her . it's an unusual and fascinatingly compelling fairy tale type of drama , steeped in feeling and intellect and romance . " kissed " is based on the original story by barbara gowdy " we so seldom look on love , " and directed with economy in her first feature by canadian lynne stopkewich . what makes this film standout , is that the subject matter is necrophilia . this is never followed up . but for sandra the dead bodies are a means of transcendence . . . the reason it's a detriment , is because her story is more dynamic and compelling than his . one of the really amazing things about ths film is that it's all believable . it's handled in a romantic and even comical way , allowing us to see the characters for what they are instead of sensationalizing their fetishes . there were three very good performances : jay brazeau sets a sobering tone for the story to be grounded in reality , no matter how far-fetched it may seem . peter outerbridge brings a sensitivity and restlessness to his role , as someone whose curiosity is so great that he's willing to try something that is ghoulish . but the film belongs to molly parker's absorbing translation of her role , as an ordinary person who is compelled to do what she feels most pressing inside her . the film comes with voice-overs from molly , in her quiet , gentle voice , and the photography at times becomes glowing in a heavenly whiteness or darkly pressing in a sobering blue shade . the film always felt dreamlike , like it was a fairy tale without a moral lesson to it . the film's only fault is in how slight the story is and how it failed to go beyond the shocking taboo point of its " crossing over " theme and really explore that untested subject matter in more depth . but the film is still a special one because of the freshness of its ideas , the originality of the film's theme , and the way it was so artfully filmed .
rating:2 an invigorating charlie chan escapade and the best one in the series , featuring sidney toler as chan . the film reaches its climax after several plot twists when there's a challenge between rhadini and zodiac , which charlie asks lewis's paper to sponsor . this wasn't a tough one to figure out who did it , but the story was a seamless one . it was a fun film , and one also got a chance to see the san francisco version of the 1939 world's fair .
rating:1 when don pedro agrees , serafin tells the audience that i am macoco . there are several surprises in the works and an outstanding dance number by the nicholas brothers . this highly entertaining film overcomes its stagy plot with some lively cole porter tunes , gorgeous costumes and scenery design , and a lot of energy from the talented cast . all told , this an enjoyable and lighthearted work , one of the director's minor works .
rating:1 this film has a gentle way of showing the war between the bureaucrats of big business and the little man caught in the squeeze of downsizing for greater company profits . how effective the film was , depended on how much you thought hopkin's change mattered . i only felt i was seeing a frank capra type of social-issue picture , that only goes surface deep , accenting how wonderful and eccentric the little guy is and how cold-hearted are the corporation types , resulting in too many generalizations of each type . but the place has not kept up with the modern times and is in need of a shot in the arm . the film will keep track of how the likable but goofy carey does in the romance department . this happy ending seemed artificial . . . too
rating:1 director-writer andrew l . stone keeps the terse story tense despite the almost certain proof the murder suspect is indeed the guilty one , but he leaves open that it is not absolutely certain until the climactic scene . at first , cameron is reluctant to believe that the very loving , prim and pretty lynne is capable of murder . this is a well-acted thriller and it is directed with some nice touches , as when cotten is romancing her on the deck and a door opens to a burst of laughter from some ship party goers . at that point the air went out of cotten , as he thought maybe it wasn't murder , but the druggist made an honest mistake , after all these kind of accidents happen all the time .
rating:3 life in this remote country village , called varkut , is oppressive , with nothing to do but work hard and eat a lot and watch bland tv programs . there is a coldness and distance about her , that speaks ill of hungarian society and its lack of warmth . the fierce b/w camera work captures the look of devastation on his face . the oppression is so great , that it is not even overtly mentioned , it is just taken for granted . but it is not pity that she needs , nor is it love that she can find or thinks she needs . this first feature-length directorial effort of m ? sz ? ros is staggering emotionally . its heartfelt dramatics and sparse dialogue , help make it a film of great quality and integrity . there is no soft pedaling of reality to spare the orphan's feelings .
rating:1 the moody atmospheric film moves at a snail's pace , giving me the impression that it is about to say something important , but everything turns out to lead forlornly down a dead-end . also , the main characters are not the nicest of people , making it difficult to sympathize with them . it could be said that this was one of the director's more trying melodramatic efforts , except for the stylish photography and the use of mediterranean shades of yellow , orange and brown for its outside shots , and for the indoor shots of the many rooms it shows , there are various shades of blue , to give the film a pleasing artistic look . for antonioni , contrast is the main thing to show about life : as sometimes things go good , sometimes things go rotten . the story , the dialogue , the characters , and the pace of the film are done in such a lethargic way , that it radically diminishes the love story . even the sex , which was plentiful , is carried out in such an unenthusiastic way , that it wasn't erotic . yet , what gives the film a certain sense of elegance , underlying its ennui , is that the director is aiming all his guns at being thematic . this is a film that could only expect to be well-received by a receptive intellectual audience of antonioni film buffs , who have the patience and understanding to embrace its arcane premises , vexing story , and the litany of existential themes the director is prone to . niccolo is anxious to find out who she knew that might be doing this , but his search is done in such a half-hearted way , that it creates little tension . the film's main purpose is not the story or the mystery , but in showing the difficulty it is to have a successful relationship in these civilized times . everyone's life seems to be too complicated to just love each other without finding other reasons to either breakup or stay together . the film goes out of its way to show how alienated and isolated the main characters are : mavi and niccolo are driving in a fog that is so thick one can't see anything , as they get lost for awhile while walking on the highway ; there are countless shots of doors opening and closing and of serious people talking to each other but not communicating . the only logical thing niccolo can say at the party to mavi is , " do all your parties have this sectarian atmosphere ? therefore , he will make a film that is impossible to digest , about spacemen going to the sun to find out what the source of power means to mankind . it's a film stuck on ideas and many metaphors , but they are dragged around by a static story , trying too hard to show how negative and cold the world has become . the film is not helped by having its central character being such a selfish and uncaring dolt , while pretending to be an intellectual . most of the warmth in the film came from the photography , which is not enough of a reason for me to get over how vacant the story felt . yet , it is a film from the master director antonioni , covering his favorite theme of alienation , and he is someone whose poorer films are still worth seeing , as there is always some nugget to be found . the nugget i found , is that the director is suggesting that in this " age of alienation , " it is more fun and realistic to make a childlike fantasy film than an idealized love story .
rating:2 this is a steven spielberg dreamworks project film . her unattentive folks don't even realize what is eating at her , that she wants an unneeded breast enlargement , and that she lacks self-esteem , thinking of herself as being unattractive . ricky and lester will share this same vision of life , as this becomes the film's mantra , reinforced several times throughout the film : that redemption can be gotten through love . this mantra will also be repeated at the end of the film , before the credits are shown . the viewer is told by lester , from the other world : that if you don't share the film's piercing vision of what really matters , someday you will . the lesson to be learnt is , that love is the only thing that can't be completely taken away from people ; it remains behind everything that is . this alan ball script , his debut assignment in films , is bristling with comedy and hard lessons to learn about life for these unfulfilled characters . if normalcy is the thing that the families are striving for , even if that is quickly seen as a sham , then what the director brilliantly does , is shoot down any hope for his characters ever being normal , even those who might think that they are normal . so what are they striving for , if not normalcy ? what results is a darkly satirical story that was equisitively directed . it makes sound points about the fallacy of normalcy and the necessity of nonconformity , and that its barbs about suburbia are on target . but the film succeeds , and in some regards is brilliant , not because some of the flawed characters see the light of day at last and might possibly reform , but because the acting was grand by everyone , and spacey was more than grand , his was a tour-de-force performance . he has the ability to squeeze humor out of a stone and turn frightening at the drop of a dish . he's that good of an actor to carry this film , even as he is supported by a terrific cast , he still stands out as the star . bening is his perfect foil , with a special flare for comedy , but still , through no fault of hers , is a cardboard villain , with no room to grow . mena is in an exploitive role , one that calls for an obligatory porn shot of her breasts ; but she is delicious and appealing , and brings more to the part than can be expected , even crying out for sympathy by the film's end . thora , a 17-year-old veteran actress , even at that tender age , played a twisted and sullen figure , but nevertheless came off as a sympathetic figure , giving a soulful performance , in a role that reminded many people of one that christina ricci would play , but not necessarily play better . cooper did a fine job as a homophobic and a closet homosexual , but his role as a villain was also too one-dimensional to give his character a more introspective edge to it , even if his performance was first-class . so why did i just like the film very much but not love it ? i think it is because , as entertaining as this film was , something just didn't smell right about these roses ; everything discovered seemed to be only something that is surface ; there was no real revolution of character going on . i think there were too many contradictions in the lives of lester , ricky , and jane to believe that they found what they were looking for , even if , the film implies that is just what they did do . the satire also became mean-spirited , at this point , as i took exception to some of the jokes plied from these scenes , as they seemed to be mocking those who take such jobs , by implying those jobs are just for losers . his character was actually the most interesting one in the film , since he saw things the others couldn't see , yet i suspect there is something deeply wrong with a teenager who has to find love by being a voyeur and material success by being a drug dealer , no matter how it is explained away . when you think about what the film had to say and distance yourself from all the fine performances and the splendid cinematography that the 70-ish-year-old master of his craft , conrad l . hall , gave us , who is an expert on lighting techniques , and you step away from the sharp wit found in alan ball's dazzling script-- what you are left wondering about , is how shallow it all is , in a film that has a bite to its satire but not enough of a bite to dig into the characters other than what is seen on the surface . in the end , this is primarily a hollywood type of film and all the hype about how daring and nonconventional this film is , should be dismissed as nothing but hype . yet it is a captivating film , one that had its moments of grandeur , and all-in-all , i really was absorbed in it , and somehow liked the film more than i probably should have .
rating:1 it is hard for me to believe that one of the world's greatest directors and one of my favorites , paul cox ( lonely hearts/my first wife/man of flowers/cactus/a woman's tale ) , made a film that was so saintly that it seemed to be without dramatic affect or chinks in its pious armor . this is not a commercial film , nor one that tends to compromise its serious tone in order to become more entertaining . it is a true story that tries not to flinch from the suffering it presents and from the altruistic virtues of the dedicated priest who is only interested in comforting those shunned by society because of leprosy . it eschews the tricks of filmmaking in its presentation of such a morbid subject , to its detriment . there is no bend in this film . in this beautifully shot film on the island of kalaupapahe , catching the lushness of the hawaiian islands , cox has taken the subject matter of suffering to a new degree of intensity and requires the viewer to be either fully absorbed in it or else it would be impossible to feel anything about such a miserable topic as 19th century leprosy ( hansen's disease ) . there is medicine for treating leprosy as of 1940 , but the undeveloped countries still can't afford that medicine , so the disease is still around . and as brilliant a study as this is , taking on such a difficult subject , this brilliance fails to amount to anything more than being a history lesson about hawaii and about those banished to die alone from that disease on an abandoned hawaiian island called molokai . he is so touched by this , that the first leper he sees , who is a child , he not only touches but embraces . unfortunately , the storytelling remains flat despite the superb character performance by the australian david wenham . in one scene , the most dramatic one in the film , lepers are tossed off the boat docked on the island's harbor and many of them drown . it is a scene of immense cruelty , but seems to have happened as if it were a dream and not real , as not much is made of it and the film just continues on without giving pause to that event . the film just couldn't say more about the priest except that he made conditions better , converted many to catholicism , and contacted the disease and died , relieved to know that the nuns have come at last and that there is another priest to carry on the work . these are fine accomplishments , but i'm afraid , they are not dramatic enough to energize this film . i felt anguished about all the piety i was seeing , but the film despite all its obvious flaws lingered with me for a long time afterwards and i'm not quite sure why . that is why i liked it better when the film had a chance to sink in , than i did when first watching it . it's a tough film to enjoy and i'm not sure i learned anything about suffering from it , that is if i was supposed to , but i do think i saw someone who i believe is an actual saint , and he was a spellbinding saintly figure despite being so unapproachable . it was the very best thing i have to say about a tedious film that i am glad i saw , even if i was not entertained by it .
rating:2 this debut indie film for director steven soderbergh is a stimulating but perverse psychological drama . the film is invasive sexually , but not in an explicit way , as there is no nudity and the film eschews sensationalism for an honest verbal character study . it is more interested in telling about the gulf between what is felt and what is perceived , as the main characters try to articulate what is at the root of their problems . at the cannes film festival , this low budget film , made for about $1 . 2 million , deservedly won la palme d'or for best film and the best actor award for james spader . this is much more than a voyeuristic film , as everything becomes personal . the script is intelligent ; the acting is superb ; and , the director has elicited spontaneous and natural performances , weaving it into a film where having a conversation about masturbation is as natural as talking about the weather . this is a film where sex is always kept as an intriguing mystery and a part of the story that adds spice to the wry humor of the events . and the trophy wife , can only respond , " i like the stability and john's promotion . " all the sexual ambiguity they both have for each other changes into a real liking they have for each other and an acceptance of how they are damaged goods but have the possibilty of changing for the better . the clever story becomes very emotionally satisfying , even if it ties things up a little too neatly .
rating:1 this very bitter film , a retread of " the blue angel , " might appeal to fans of the great french actress jeanne moreau , in one of her best performances ever , who plays eva with a true intensity . she is the soul of the film , making this dark and improbable story have some teeth to bite into . it is filmed in a coldly sweeping baroque style . the jazzy musical score is by michel legrand , and the great billie holiday song " weep for me , " is most appropriate for the down mood the film idles on from beginning to end . the principal characters were simply not only not likable , lovable , or even cordial , they are personifications of a destructive god , willing to take not only themselves down , but anyone else who gets in their way . the story itself is the film's problem , because it is so unsettling and foolishly perverse , that it never promises any sunlight , so what is seen in the film's first fifteen minutes is exactly what you get by the finale , in a film that drags on for too long , coming to no point but trying its best to bring you down with its sour look at life . the only kind thing that can be said about the femme fatale , is that she's upfront with him . this scathing romance , which abstains from love , instead it favors romance as being something that darkly possesses you , as the flawed protagonist leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth . it's film that basically is asking two unanswerable questions : how do you explain a woman's love for a guy who is no good ? losey lets the pessimistic mood of the story prevail as his answer . . .
rating:1 i expected this film , given its clich ? subject matter , to be worst than it turned out . in fact , it had its moments in the snow of actually looking like pure cinema . jacques tourneur should be credited for making this wartime propaganda piece into an acceptable action film , shunning politics for a typical hollywood wartime heroics and romance story . the film presented new and unknown actors , and only one of them , in his first motion picture , after appearing on the broadway stage , gregory peck , had any kind of star quality . need i say more on how she got the part ! but to her credit , she handled the role decently . this film was a ringing tribute to our wartime allies , the noble soviets . this would be a source of embarrassment in the coming years . the film predictably plods along to its climax , as nina delivers a message to the russian general in the field and he gives her a coded message , which is the one peck was waiting for , as he gets just as excited about the message as he does about holding nina in his arms . the film failed miserably with the critics and at the box office , but it wasn't that bad . . . it even had a certain corny charm to it that some might find appealing .
rating:3 those two great legends in the horror field went on from here to make a total of seven films together , but none as co-stars with equal parts , or in a feature that was as good as this one was . in most of their films together , lugosi , who was the poorer actor of the two because of his limited english , was always cast in the lesser role . the script for this film was altered so much , that the only thing remaining from poe's story , is the brief appearance of the black cat in the film . though the film does evoke the mood of a poe story and the feelings of kafka . the crowley characterization was by boris karloff , who played the role of hjalmar poelzig . he will mention that he is a writer of mystery books , and he quickly adds , books that are unimportant , and that if he had any sense he would be honeymooning in niagara falls . he then offers an excuse for vitus's action , saying he has a common phobia , but in an extreme form . that the result is an intense horror of cats . there's not much action , but it is very eerie to watch this strange scene . the film is very strong on atmosphere , shot in the style of german expressionism . it is not as strong on plot development or of the story making complete sense . but as a film shot originally as a programmer for universal , this horror film turns out to be a work of true art , and is still one of the best horror films ever made . it is a film of subtle and subversive gestures and one that sets a disquieting mood . this is ulmer's masterpiece , his defining work .
rating:1 the story is bogged down with cliches and cardboard characters , while the ballet dancing is the thing of beauty in this film . most of the dancers are professionals of the highest standards and it shows by their excellent performance . the framework of the story is the same formula seen in almost every hollywood sports film , as the art of dancing is only paid lip service to . in fact , if this film wasn't about ballet dancers , it could have been about chorus dancers or football players , and the same trite tale could have been woven . which shows you how much art mattered . the best reason for seeing the film , is that the dancing is alive and pulsating , choreographed by the likes of balanchine , susan stroman and christopher wheeldon , as well as ivanov and macmillan . the film is hip to ballet dancers , letting us in on the secret that many of the male dancers are gay , and a straight dancers is much welcomed by the ladies . and , that they can be easily devasted by criticism of their performance . it is was too much effort following all their predictable stories , especially when you know everything is going to be tied up in a nice pink ribbon by the end . this film reminded me a lot of hollywood's ode to lowbrow culture " band wagon , " which was much more entertaining . in center stage , there was plenty of dancing at rehearsals and in the two big ballet numbers they put on , before the film comes to its predictable climax for its soap opera stories . the aim of the film was to be entertaining , the art part it dumbed down for mass consumption , though its story could have been worst than it actually was , as it was kept in check from completely taking over the film . what it comes down to , is that the story didn't completely take away from the dance , therefore the film had some mild entertainment value and some sparkle could be detected in the eyes of the students when they were dancing .
rating:1 inspired by a pushkin novel , which it considerably watered down , " the eagle " has been adapted to the screen by the sure-handed clarence brown , in a tribute to the kind of adventure story douglas fairbanks popularized in his silent 1922 robin hood film and in his zorro role in 1920 the mark of zorro . this film is a tale of adventure , romance , and intrigue , with a good deal of tongue-in-cheek comedy thrown in to help the predictable story out . it was a very popular film in its time . this , his penultimate film , is a good example of how his mannered acting and striking latin looks , made him a ladies favorite . the film also has the great art designer , william cameron menzies , do its breathtaking sets . carl davis does the musical arrangements in the updated film version , adding the russian touch to the ongoing screen action , with music by tchaikovsky , rimski-korsakoff , and prokofiev . the film was set in the 18th century , but the costumes were from more modern times . valentino is dashing in the role , but it is difficult to see what made him so popular from this movie . i feel the same way about james dean when i see his films . but there must have been something beyond what was seen onscreen to explain his tremendous appeal . this satisfying film is a good one to determine for yourself what there is about him that had his lady fans swoon over him . it is a large-scale picture , giving him a chance to do both action and romantic scenes , the kind of serious acting he wasn't asked to do in his previous films .
rating:0 a fluff sitcom , romantic comedy , that is so charming that it eventually suffocates on all the charm it gives off . it is cleverly written and directed by irish playwright gerard sternbridge , who can't stop showing off how clever he is able to make his main character . the film was shot almost a year before " almost famous " made kate hudson into a celebrity , and a golden globe winner and oscar nominee for best supporting actress . in any case , kate does a flawless irish accent . he's a bullshit artist extraordinaire , with an easy manner about him , who cunningly knows how to reach out to women , which was mildly satisfactory for about 45 minutes of the film but after that became annoying . his gracious smile soon looked too smug and unbecoming , as the story had no particular meaning to it and i have seen too many recent films with studs in it to care how this silly story resolved itself . this film resolved itself in the cute way the story was heading , a 'feel good' film for those with an amoral bent and a belief that having sex with as many women as possible is the best thing one can do to improve relationships . for all the main characters there's a voice-over used to spell out their thoughts and also captions of their thoughts are at times flashed onscreen . scenes are also repeated so we get reactions from different individuals . the film's main purpose seems to be in showing what a likable rake adam is -- that he is willing to meet the needs of whomever he's with . he proves that having secrets in a relationship can add spice to it and make it an even more serene and lasting one . this is contrasted with adam being shown by the film's end as a pathological liar and an uncaring sexist . the film's image of him left me confused about what i was supposed to think of him . but my gut reaction is , i had a belly full of this guy long before the film ended and therefore found this vacuous story unsatisfying . it was like i was being asked to overlook adam's failings and be won over by his obviously trite charms . i wasn't and therefore didn't care for adam , or the film , or did i particularly care for any of the sisters . the only thing i liked in the film was the jaguar , and i didn't care how adam got it or what story he told about how he got it . that was supposed to be funny and show that he might have some problems with telling the truth .
rating:1 the dinner game is such a scenario . some might find this fast-moving play to be smart and witty . but i didn't . he does that mainly through phone conversations , whereby he has a knack for saying the wrong thing and making things worst . jacques villeret is an appealing fool , whose good-heart shines throughout the farce , even though he proves to be a true numbskull . there were a few laughs to be had , but this is really tv sitcom material and not great wit .
rating:0 one of the most obnoxious sci-fi films ever . it offers hollywood's silly response to the 1950s red scare sweeping the country and promoted by the mccarthy senate hearings looking for commies under every bed cover . to realize how dumb this cold war film is , try this summation of the plot on for size : can it be that the martians are signaling earth and that their leader is that actually uttering the very word of god ? warning : spoilers are throughout review . this is one of those really bad propaganda films that has no entertainment value , as it shows how paranoic this country can be and how it can use religion at the drop of a radio signal to promote materialism and christianity as a superior way of life than communism . this one might be the strangest and most twisted red menace films of all time . the last message heard from mars is an abbreviated one ( thank god ) : " ye have done well my good . . . " then there is just silence . don't ask me to explain how all of a sudden ninety percent of the world workforce would lose their jobs and there would be a run on the banks because of this message . but that's exactly what this filmmaker is asking us to believe . but just when things look bleak for the free world , a spiritual message comes delivered on a different frequency . it's christ's " sermon on the mount . " this red scare movie is made for zombies from another planet , or witch hunters who want to justify how their dirty work is necessary . it's a classic in a negative sense , a must see for those who can't believe how a bad film can really be bad .
rating:1 there's supposed to be no one aboard the ship , but all the passengers say they received a call from daniels to come aboard ; though , daniels denies ever making such a call . the boat remains at the dock , as charlie keeps everyone on the ship . he's a movie actor , travelling incognito . but , as is usually the case in this series , the least likely one is the guilty party . but the story itself made little sense . what was outstanding , was the atmospheric harbor scenes . this gave the film an eerie feeling and made the fishy story seem less briny .
rating:1 a noble idea for a film to satire some of the best known american pop culture heroes of the 1950s , as directed by the britisher nicolas roeg , from a terry johnson play conceived in 1982 . the film often misses the target , but since it throws everything into the mix , it sometimes is delightfully on target , providing both amusement and thought-provoking reactions . the fictionalized encounters , which try to capture the essence of the pop culture characters rather than depicting them as real-life characters , though using what knowledge the public has of them , the characterizations seem pretty close to the truth . what really makes this film work , are the excellent performances by the stars . marilyn is the life of the film , presenting a sexy and engaging sex goddess , who is both vulnerable and pushy . einstein is upset by that , mentioning that knowledge isn't something that is true-- it's just an agreement made by people that makes it seem true . the film is a bit of a mess , with no certain plot and it seems to have no particular aim it hopes to accomplish . but as a diverting look at these fantasies of the four 1950 icons , it makes for provocative theater and in the process , it sometimes offers us some inspired thoughts to think about . it sort of sucks you along for its ride and you don't mind going along because its kind of fun to imagine how those characters really were . the film's efforts might be comparable to a guy fantasizing how it would be to sleep with marilyn monroe .
rating:2 a messenger gives andrews a note marked very important , but when opened it is of trivial concern . it concludes with an action-packed finale , which is not usually the case for the more cerebral way charlie solves his cases . but there's the usual twist in plot to catch you by surprise as to who the gang leader is . it made for a very entertaining film , a solid charlie chan vehicle even though there's less detective work done in this chan episode than in others .
rating:2 dark city is a sci - fi/noir thriller , that portends to deliver a message relating to the powers of the mind and the meaning of identity . everything attempted here has been done before , but that still doesn't take away from the film's feeling of looking like it is an original . credit must go to the creative use of special effects and the outstanding set designs used for its bedimmed city . and since he is not sure if he did it or not , he has a dazed look on his puss , like he will have throughout the entire film . hurt is the deadpan , hard - nosed type of movie cop you would see in a 40s noir film , leading the investigation . he will be on the run for the remainder of the film , innocent though he may be , just like a protagonist in earlier noir films , questioning authority and trying to pull himself together , unsure of whom to trust . his visit to the automat brought back pleasant memories of my childhood in nyc , but this automat was cheerless and cold , only its bright lights served as a sharp contrast to the dark eeriness of this city . he falls in love with her anyway , and the message of the film becomes only too clear , it is in the heart that the individual is born , and the heart can't be dissected and experimented with like a science blinded by technology and ignorant of the imagination . proyas has created a visually challenging movie , that is backed - up by some thoughtful ideas . it is the kind of film that ufo'ers and alien watchers will tell ya' , see , i told you there was life out there in space . but to others , this is still only pedestrian stuff , it is not the real deal . and the flat acting did not add anything positive to the story . i enjoyed the film for its ambience and for the creative mood it set . but what diminished its positives , was how the main purpose of the actors seemed to be , to spout robotic messages for the characters they were portraying . i wished that proyas had enough confidence to allow his visions to do the talking .
rating:2 it is noted for the understated but tense performance by anthony perkins and the electric and a very passionate performance by geraldine chaplin , where you can actually feel her pain and sympathize with her even though she's the aggressor . setting the dark and torturous mood with her soundtrack is alberta hunter's most appealing blues score , which she also performs . tak fujimoto's camera is sharp in its character delineation , cutting deeply into this tale of revenge with its powerful close-ups . a sense of foreboding violence and a quirky sense of humor go very well together in this film , as emily has this crazed and confused look about her and speaks in an unnatural almost comical tone , as if she forgot how to speak and is learning it anew . she succeeds in messing with neil's life and gains the viewer's sympathy , as she seems to be more of a victim than at first thought . the irony in it , is all the main characters watch the news report , but it is too impersonal for them to even react to it , they are too overwhelmed with the problems in their personal life to care about anyone else . i remembered emily's name by the time the film ended , and felt moved by her strained performance and all the emotions , pathos , and humor that was in it . the film was too arty at times , as is the want of the director , but it is a gripping film , one that i recommend for the way it outstandingly depicts the subtleties in the way the characters act .
rating:1 thin red line , the ( director : andrew marton ; cast : keir dullea ( pvt . the idea that war is insane is the underlying theme of this violent actioner , that questions the sanity of why men go to war . sgt . the film's title signifies the thin red line that one crosses between sanity and insanity in a war situation . but sgt . the gory combat scenes and the heroics of the men and the craziness of the war , are vividly photographed , leaving one with a mixed impressions , perhaps , wondering if this is what it takes to win the battle , and if that is so , is it worth the price it takes to accomplish the mission . the images of the dead in the swamp , tagged with dogtags in their mouth , was appalling to behold , it is a scene that should leave one feeling a bit eerie . this version of the thin red line is quite different from terrence malick's depersonalized 1998 one . it was a straight hard-nosed story , with no grandiose philosophical themes . its message might be read into sgt . welsh' last words , as he is asked , " why did he take a bullet for someone like doll , someone he didn't even like , " and he responds , " because i'm stupid . " this is a blunt statement , but after all the bloody battle scenes observed , and the heavy losses on both sides , it is a fair question to ask and the response might not be one that can be taken literally , but it is one that is wrapped around a lot of emotions that can't be articulated properly but can sure be felt .
rating:1 a too obvious derivative supernatural thriller , most imitative of " rosemary's baby , " but without the same fresh intensity and without a credible script . what it had going for it , was a sleek look ( the cinematography was simply out of this world ) and an able workmanlike craftsmanship . rand ravich does a fine job directing his initial film , but fails miserbly with the storytelling part of his script . this results in a film that is watchable but not believable . in this arty mystery , which doesn't have too much mystery if you watched a few of these supernatural films before , spencer and streck come back different men from what they were before they experienced the two minutes of mystery . without a mystery to end on , the film becomes banal , having established no point of view and having nothing to say about space travel , it just becomes a predictable guessing game of how jillian will defend herself against her husband , someone who is really not her husband .
rating:1 it is shot in a semi-documentary style and looked more like a crime caper movie than the film noir category most film critics have classified it under . the story of duke malloy catches ferguson's interest . to make the film more snappy the producers called in raoul walsh , though not credited , to shoot some scenes over . but the filmlooks dated .
rating:2 a thoroughly delightful documentary by allan miller ( small wonders ) about the putting on of puccini's turandot opera . the china production features 900 hand-embroided costumes , made by 2 , 000 workers , that are authentic from the ming period . as an aside , we are told the soldiers thought the opera music at first sounded like mooing cows , but later on they began to enjoy it even humming some of the tunes . but the opera works as does the documentary , which is more about the intricacies of staging it then it is about the opera itself . the film could appeal to opera buffs as well as to those who never saw an opera , as it passionately shows the clashes of culture between the east and the west and differences about artistic ideas among the crew more than it does anything else . this seems to blend in perfectly with the opera being staged , which is also overblown with passion . " authenticity " is what makes zubin jump with rosy delight as his sense of artistic merit is realized by his moves to keep the production as a collaboration that is an international effort . he is most proud that it is being shown for the first time in beijing , the place the opera was originally set in . but zhang yimou looks sullen throughout , with a constant worry that something will go wrong in this unwieldy production and it will embarrass the chinese people . there's a for real clash with the italian director of opera lighting , guido levi , over the intensity of the light , which adds zest to the film . zhang , always the perfectionist , wants the bright lights to match those of the bright costumes , but only gets grief from the self-important italian . at one point zhang gives a coaches's football-like inspirational talk to some crew members saying : that he accepted the project " to win credit for the chinese , " and expects them to do well . it was also amusing to watch the overweight diva sharon sweet go into a snit about not wearing a tiny headdress because it made her look ugly . if not solved , the man is beheaded . there's some pieces of opera music played which were very pleasing ( such as the aria 'nessun dorma' ) . also interesting were the shots contrasting the opera setting in the ming dynasty with the routine life in modern beijing and its new hi-risers , and its citizens craving for consumer goods such as cell phones and tv's as they seem to be embarked on building a totalitarian style materialistic society . it was troubling not knowing anything about those tailors brought in to make the costumes--were they slave laborers ? nevertheless , it was amusing to learn of the differences of watching an opera in the west and in china . in the west , opera is treated as a very serious work and the theater remains quiet during the performance . mainly this is a film about what goes on backstage when you put on an opera , and that in itself was a treat to see . yet i didn't find these unpleasant incidentals damaging enough to interfere with zubin's aim to celebrate the different cultures by putting on this opera in beijing . zubin and miller had a different agenda than either the communist regime or for that matter zhang , and if the gap could be bridged through music that would be of benefit to world peace .
rating:2 a nifty postmodern cowboy-noir and black comedy , filmed in a drab technicolor that seems appropriate for this film , as the colorization is not ostentatious and thereby makes the characters appear more real . the story is aimed at striking your funny bone and getting you dizzy in following all the plot twists . it features all the familiar noir clich ? s : femme fatale , an innocent man trapped in the world of criminals , and is written by the dahl brothers and directed with tongue-in-cheek humor by john dahl , and despite the clich ? s , the film feels original . it's the type of film that seems to be best-suited for video , where it still made its biggest splash . but not our hero . . . who is neither straight nor crooked , just a guy who gets into tight spots and tries to do what is right . all this happens in the first reel . " red rock west " is a playful and off-beat thriller , whose only sense it makes is nonsense , but one that is highly entertaining , while the film itself is well executed and the acting is dead-pan funny . so it hardly matters that this murky story is not plausible and certainly not cerebral . it has received cult status because of its many plot twists and zany characters , which means it will pop up on late night cable at any time in the future and that should be for years to come .
rating:2 the cast is superb . it is rare that a film has such a meaty part for one woman to play . . . this film has two such parts . the girls never seemed taken with a genuine love of music except as it suited their talents . the well-crafted screenplay by frank cottrell boyce , is ably directed by tucker , who is directing his first feature film . the only fault i found with his direction , is that i thought it was unnecessary to have duplicate scenes of what hilary and jackie experienced , that is , we didn't have to see it from each one's point of view . i thought the film would have been better served if the action was continuous , the going back over the same scenes from a different point of view really killed the pace of the film , slowing it down too much . this is a film that glows with confidence , sparked by a maturity of material , that tries to unravel some of the mysteries in life that make one wonder about certain decisions made that can impact one's entire life . the film worked so well because of the contrasts between the two female stars , they prevented the film from burying itself in a pit of sadness and , also , it was deftly handled by the director's ability to keep the movie light , not to make jackie's situation into a downer . . . and the music helped , it was simply marvelous .
rating:1 saskia emotes in a contrasting understated performance to the energetic amanda's . at one point the sweet talking miriam declares , " mother , auntie kathy , a girl at swimming--and eunice , those are all the people who have kissed me . " this is a pointless , violent road movie about two very sick girls , who are not explained or studied , but are just shown to be on a wreckless course of destruction . but judy might also be viewed as a figment of her warped mind , or perhaps she represents someone from the bible , like the avenger named judith who beheaded an enemy of the israelites . amanda displays a death wish , saying , " i'm bad , i won't change . punishment is all i understand . " it is not possible to make sense of how these girls relate to each other and how brutally they act . the depravity and depth of alienation she evokes from her character , and the energy that amanda plummer puts into her characterization , make this a fascinating film , if you can ever get past the bleakness of the story .
rating:1 a visually pleasing but unmoving homage biopic of the 18th-century spanish painter francisco goya . the director , carlos saura , has had trouble with the storytelling part of his films in the past , as his great craftsmanship skills seem to far exceed his other abilities as a filmmaker . the film opens in a surreal manner as a cow's carcass seems to be dragging itself over a dirt red field to a scaffold and then raises itself up as its flesh opens and its insides are exposed . it was goya's belief that man without imagination is only an animal , and this is the first lesson we are taught in this pedantic film study of him . the film never touched base with the painter and his great works of art . it seemed like a dry lecture , with the artist's paintings laboriously put on display , making for some gorgeous framed shots , but not offering a film that is emotionally touching . what we learn is that goya was a flawed man , feeling himself to be cowardly and weak-spirited at times , whose great influences to overcome his shortcomings were , vel ? zquez , rembrandt , and his imagination tied to reason . but the film itself does not let on why we should assume goya was a great painter , it seems to have failed the artist in that sense . i was left with the impression that if this film would continue in its pedantic way of telling the story , it is possible in part 2 that we would know why that was so .
rating:0 this sci-fi'er left a lot to be desired . it didn't work out in 3-d , its original intention of how it was to be shown , as the public's taste for that fad cooled , or in the conventional 2-d , how it was actually shown when released . for the first 30 minutes or so i felt i was stuck in a detention classroom for dummies ( ah ! even if these machines could do a 1 , 000 times the work man can do , they were also a 1 , 000 times deadlier than man , and this reactionary story dwells on the negative side of what machines could do , even if the machine in this instance is a magnificent brain . the action in the film , which is none too thrilling , is in watching how many of the 150 workers will get killed and what novel ways are the killings to be done . if the film was funny or its technology was more interesting , or if the killings weren't so melodramatic , and the acting not so staid , and the patriotic jingoism wasn't so shrill , i might have found this film bearable . but since that wasn't the case , i found the film to be an academic bore .
rating:0 in my opinion , a movie reviewer's most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion . but with soul survivors , i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned . however , protocol forces me to do otherwise . rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material . in his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion . when the movie's camerawork isn't pedestrian , it's clich ? d . carpenter's need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation . we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here . carpenter's script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness . this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around . and guess what ? this movie has both ! not that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile . since there's no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere . that's a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples . carpenter can't even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it . [the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats . -ed . ] when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts . regardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity . why wouldn't they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ? the cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes . i felt sorry for affleck , who i've liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty . and i'm not even getting into luke wilson's role as a priest . bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it . rating : * [lowest rating] |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------| mpaa rating : pg-13
rating:3 simply put , this is one of the best crime films ever made . especially considering that it was made on a budget of only $230 , 000 . it most closely resembles in style and scope the work of the great french directors jean-pierre melville and jacques becker , as a classic noir tale depicting man's foibles of greed and betrayal . the the robbery itself is told in multiple flashback style , as each character gets a chance to tell his version of the story , which is done in parts , so that each character's story is not only told but the film is able to jump back and forth in time , allowing for several events to happen together . she also clearly had the two best lines in the film : if people didn't have headaches , what would happen to the aspiren industry ? what makes this film so tense and gripping , is the exacting details that went into making this caper work , as it is seen through the eyes of the odd mixture of characters who commit the robbery . the point made , is a theme that kubrick will return to many times in his long career in films , that their perfect robbery fails because of the human condition they couldn't control and not because the robbery wasn't perfectly executed . it fits in with kubrick's notion of life : that it is vital for one to see how the pieces are played out on the chess board and how the player who does not always have the best strategy or execution can still win by learning how to persevere and change as the game does . as one of kubrick's early features , it remains one of his greatest films , even without the added visual dimensions he was to pour into his later high-budget , more complex movies . the outstanding cast made everything look natural , and the gritty realism of the story was only enhanced by the glorious b/w cinematography .
rating:1 the movie is very loosely adapted from soren kierkegaard's early treatise on beauty , infatuation and the power of intellectual persuasion . but the explicit sex is kept to the minimum ; instead , it uses the need to find romance as a form of irony to point out the thin line that separates love from madness . it pretends to be supportive of philosophy and its intrinsic intellectual powers that society has very little value for , but does not move the film in that direction . instead , it opts for light comedy . the chemistry is much better between sebastien and anne , a match that no one can possibly believe should be taking place , but is funny to watch as the opinionated and pushy sebastien operates his inane charm on the sophisticated and attractive older woman , until she nearly makes a complete fool of herself . with all these characters and precarious situations abounding , the movie still had a flatness to it , though , admittedly , in some spots the craziness of the characters was hilarious . the flatness is derived from some spark that is missing from the film . as for me , i wasn't taken with the main character , gregoire , and therefore , had little interest in his strange love affair and his affixation with magic . the story itself was weakened by its not being developed further . it seemed to be thrown together as if it were a series of comedy skits . the film did have a good sense of tongue-in-cheek humor , keeping it lighthearted . but for a film about a book a great philosopher wrote , not to be thoughtful , is in my humble opinion , only an example of a filmmaker trying so hard to be devilish but succeeding only in becoming vulgar in a philistine way .
rating:2 homegrown is a lovable off-the-wall film that , probably , very few people have seen or even heard about . that might be because the film goes off on so many different directions-- from murder to counter-culture romance-- before it zeroes into the hippy drug dealing scene as it evolved from the '60s to what it is today , which makes it a too controversial topic for sony to know how to advertise and release to theaters . this is a film that you will probably only get a chance to see on cable or video . its highly animated story is both funny and suspenseful , with a good deal of its plot made up of the kind of material reserved for a sociologist who is writing a treatise on why certain types of people must be outlaws ; the director's aim was to make a take-off on the treasure of the sierra madre theme , but this time with a stoned-out foursome lured by the possibility of making 3 million dollars through growing and dealing marijuana . a lot of the big-name stars in the film must have seen the merits of this enterprise , because their cameo appearances and the small amount of money they received for being in the film indicates that this was strictly a labor of love for them . it therefore left a very cloudy message about what is a serious matter concerning the whole drug culture . it was a much clearer film to evaluate , if viewed as an enjoyable dark comedy . but don't be mislead by what i just said . this is a well-written and acted and directed film , that is often disarmingly brilliant , getting right in the face of an outlaw lifestyle that is both dangerous and beautiful . it does this better than any other film i have seen in recent times that attempted to tackle this sort of material . the implied message is : the government's drug policy is just not working .
rating:1 a cold thriller , exploring the exploitation of violence by heaping up a huge quantity of exploitive violence itself to make some points about what is the public's attitude and tolerance level for the random violence that is present in society . in other words , this is an exploitive violent film railing against exploitive violent films , if that makes sense . by crafting an intelligent screenplay and not going for the unnecessary showing of gore , much of this is done off-screen , which might be almost as horrific as seeing the actual mayhem , the director is able to keep the film arty . they have no redeeming human features , and their cruel intent is played up for the camera's benefit , paul even winks at the camera , as if the audience is in on this game they are playing . in one of the scenes , the camera is rewound when the audience is given the gratuitous pleasure in seeing one of the sadists killed , but even this is not granted to the audience when the scene is finally rewound . paul calls peter fatty several times to the mock displeasure of peter , tom , beavis , or whoever this obese , snide monster really is . everything about these two is a facade , their phony stories of who they are and how they were brought up , their pretenses at politeness add up to zero for an audience that is left dismayed , realizing that it is only their evil that is real in this film , despite the director's aim to fictionalize the reality of this fictitious situation , to reduce everyone to a cartoon image , to make it appear that we can grow to expect violence as a natural part of life . that part doesn't work as well as the director might think it does . the family is real to the audience . i am left with the choice of how to rate the movie , knowing full well that the sophist argument is , if you don't like what you are seeing , then don't see the rest of it . that's well and good . and if that is your philosophy on how to how to handle exploitive material , i can't condemn you for it . i would think that many people of sound mind would feel this way and will walk out of the theater . but i don't think , as the director thinks , in an interview he gave , that people who stay to see the entire movie , really need the movie . i don't , necessarily , need this movie . i stayed to see if this sadistic film works its point of view out , and i was disappointed that with all its novelty and games and pretenses to high art , it offered nothing much in the way of seeing things differently . the film is successful not because of its message , but because it is a well-crafted film , from a filmmaker who knows how to make films , even if he pretends to be doing more than he is capable of . this film succeeds with the small share of the audience it can garner , because it is , surprisingly enough , an entertaining film , and it broaches a subject that is very difficult to understand , that tweaks our interest in seeing if there is anything new to say about violence . and the hope is , that we might be able to understand violence a little bit better , even if , it has to come to us by way of an unorthodox position ; and , that maybe , since violent films are so universally popular , we can somehow see the human condition on film and not be anesthetized by the reality of violence . as far as the critical success of this film goes , i think it is merely a better version of all those halloween grizzly killing pictures we are subjected to--- if you want , a high class texas chainsaw massacre film . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net
rating:2 this comedy/romance story is more about the sense of communication than it is about the mystery story or about the five senses the structure of its story is built around . it is done in a delicately stylized form , filmed mostly in dark , somber shades , as the story revolves around the characters in an office/residential building in toronto . the film moves along at a brisk pace , which kept me interested in their lives , but what the story failed to do was tell me all it can about the characters . nevertheless , i was satisfied with the film and the very sensitive nature it tapped into , as it touched a nerve in each one's character and left me caring about them , despite thinking that maybe the characters were a bit shallow . this engrossing film touches on the fears people have who are losing their senses and how they must rely on the sense that is their strongest to pull them through their difficulties . rona struggles to understand herself through the sense of taste that is both her strong and weak point . they are seen slyly talking to each other about what to avoid in a relationship , since they have both experienced many failed ones they have much in common . this sequence didn't have the flow to it the others did , and even though it was touching to see , it seemed too calculated to have much of an affect . jeremy podeswa ( eclipse ) , the writer-director , has come up with a captivating film despite the shallowness of the characters and the story being a landmine full of clich ? s . there are things shown in the relationships uncovered that bring out so many emotional qualities , as this independent film takes risks on a story line that borders on being perceived as too arty , but somehow it works because it has something to say about relationships that are so painful to bear . that i didn't get to know as much about the characters as i would have liked , gets overridden by how well the story was presented . i don't think the film would have worked if it weren't for the nuanced ways of the film and if it tried to tidy up everyone's life by the finale . the point being made , is that it is the small little things one does to stimulate one's senses that counts the most , whether it is when one reaches out for another , or when just trying to understand someone else and giving them succor , that it is by using one's senses to connect with someone else that makes life worth living . these revelations were too banal to make this more than an intriguing film . but , the story did catch and hold my interest .
rating:1 it is richly adapted from a jeffrey eugenides novel by director sofia coppola . the film is an evocative visual depiction of a typical suburban family and community . it dwells on the sadness found under all the attractive girls's smiling faces , leaving one with a lingering feeling of helplessness about their situation . adolescence is scrutinized by sofia coppola in a cinematically crafted manner , finely inspired by what we think we remember about that age when looking back at it , with the implication that the girls at that time knew more about the boys than the other way around . the boys , except for one , are insecure and clumsy around the girls . edward lachman's photography has a mesmerizing look to it , as he seems to have his camera covered with a filter to make the shots appear fuzzy , which complements a story that can't be completely put together because we don't know the answers as to why the girls' did what they did . despite liking much about the film and respecting the eclectic approach the director used , i still found that this film wasn't talking to me . i felt i was asked to be a mourner at a once in a lifetime story that has the possibility to pop up some day on the tv news as one of those bizarre events that just happen without cause , but the story itself went no deeper than how the tv news would cover it . the exploration of the teens in their growing pains , their ordinary wants , and even in their grandeur , left me scratching my head at this allegorical tale , wondering how it was that the sunshine couldn't get inside them , why they were symbolically cut down in life like the diseased elm tree in front of their house was , where i could at least see the disease in the tree's yellow leaves . i don't know how much of their futility i could see , as the more i thought about them , the more they seemed like ghosts than real people , and they all started looking like each other , so i couldn't distinguish one from the other , except for lux , who for some reason in all her boldness and sexuality , couldn't find the strength to live . which left me perplexed as to why the film thrived on not telling a complete story . if i tried to know more about the girls , i would only become like the shrink , giving off pat answers to something that was supposed to remain a mystery . i don't know if this is a good or a bad way for a film to leave the viewer , but i do know i felt something profound was missing here , as the film was more revealing about the boys and their idealization of the girls than it was about the girls and what they were really like . this seemed misplaced storytelling , since the girls' story should have been more compelling than the boys' awkward adolescent tale was . what saves this film , is the innovative way the director filmed the story , covering up the fluff to make the story look deeper than it was .
rating:1 this is a gritty , workman-like ww11 hbo made for tv movie , that is much better , surprisingly , than most of those kind of movies usually are , taking place in a battlefield in the hurtgen forest , 1944 , on the border of belgium and germany , though it was shot in hungary . the film is seen through the eyes of pvt . in a year when two epic war films were made , saving private ryan and the thin red line , this low budget movie holds its own with those films storywise , only lacking the great cinematography of those films , but its cinematography was realistic enough , aiding in the clarity of telling the story , that is highlighted by an engaging characterization by ron eldard and the other soldiers who look as if they are really ww11 soldiers . now this has been tried in many of the older ww11 films , but for the most part , it didn't work because the acting was not as convincing as these unheralded actors are . in such a short time , we feel that we know manning and know what he will do , and that his tough mental attitude seems more realistic than many of the other soldiers we see with a proper military attitude . it is hard to say for sure if we can like a person such as manning , but even as we question his motives , whether or not they are selfish , we still respect him as a man who will not blindly follow orders , even if he has to be insubordinate . this fuzziness about his character holds our interest throughout the film . each of the recent war films i have seen has its own grit and dirt to it , as they seemed to be made nowadays with a new determination to be more realistic and less all apple pie than ever before , as most of the pre-vietnam war films were . i welcome this kind of realistic filmmaking , and since war never seems to go out of style , it is worthwhile seeing how young men fight in such wars , maybe some day all sides will figure out that there is a better way to settle things . until then , there is nothing like a good war film to bring the war into our homes and consciousness , and this one is a reasonably good one .
rating:1 david lynch's lost highway , his first feature film after five years , is a surreal thriller with a puzzling plot , that asks a lot from the viewer , as far as accepting this far-fetched tale on face value . it's meant to be a non-conventional film , a shocker , an attempt at post-modern noir , an avant-garde sci-fi ghost story that is stylish and engrossing , but what it mostly is , is a confusing film that tries to be weirder than his eraserhead and blue velvet films , but is too outlandish to be compared with those superior features . it also smacks of being pretentious , of putting down the characters in nonhuman terms , as if they are so unimportant that they can easily be reincarnated to appear as someone else , without any explanation being given . it was a cold story , seemingly with psychological undertones about multiple-personality disorders that stretches logic to the breaking point . but it held my attention throughout and concludes with a roller-coast ride down a dark , desolate highway , with an ending that does little to give meaning to the puzzle . but it does complete its narrative by tieing up the loose ends of what the characters were plotting and it keeps intact its pessimistic mood . it sounded like this is something that could have been said in an adult version of an 'amos and andy' sketch . lynch then goes into exploiting his usual themes of violence , gore and dubious sexual situations and we also get to see arquette stroll around in her underwear , when she's not completely nude . she was the least interesting of all the characters , partly because of her insipid performance and partly because the two characters she played were not particularly interesting . i'm not exactly clear what it means , but a lot of things in this film serve as doubles , including the couple's house which is a double for the lost highway hotel , where some heavy-duty action takes place in the film's concluding moments . both bill pullman and balthazar getty are effective in their roles , as they both seem to be acting in a low-key mode . while the loggia role was too predictably gangsterish and seen too often in recent films to bring much to the table here ( it was second-rate in maniacal comic-viciousness compared to hopper's same type of role in blue velvet ) . the movie was somewhat effective not because of the actors or the story , but because it was elusive , atmospheric , unpredictable , different in form , and gracefully ethereal . it was a film that took chances , resulting in an uneven work , but in its dark moments was able to shine as a haunting film . if one wishes to make sense of this film , it would have to be done on a metaphorical level , and it would take dismissing logic and loving a film that relishes in its darkness and obscurity .
rating:1 it is allegedly based upon a true story , one that echoes the director's universal appeal for everyone to end all their hatred . the bitter war , seems almost to be inevitable in this over two hour film , told in a detached style , emphasizing the bloody battles , as it clearly shows how war is both hell and insanity . if the film could be faulted , it is that everyone in it is used as a symbol , which takes away some of the spontaneity of their individualism , so the characters don't really stick with us as much as the arson of the villages does and all the other catastrophes that result from the war . this is a disturbing film , not one that is easy to watch , even as its gallows humor tries to lessen the somber tone of the story .
rating:1 it's an ambitious effort about how one can preserve one's dignity in the face of poverty . the picture tries to cover much territory , in this long epic-like , period-piece production of over two hours . it seems like a mess , as the film has too many stories going all at once and too many characters coming in and out of it to follow them all , and the acting is less than compelling . as a result , it is easy to lose track of the real-life figures for the cardboard symbols they represent , as the sides are drawn up -- the good guys are the struggling actors-and-the bad guys the industrial magnates . but , fortunately , the film rises to the occasion in its uplifting finale , bringing a renewed energy for its clear-cut message to be credibly received , at last . this is an old-fashioned liberal film , preaching its humanitarian message to the choir . the unfortunate thing about the film , is that it is not terribly entertaining . the film lumbered through by showing snippets of the theater rehearsals , introducing and then forgetting about a cast the size of an army . john adair ( sheridan ) is one of the actors who pushes her on-stage to get the part and he becomes her boyfriend , in a story that left me feeling unmoved , as it was just typical hollywood goo , seen many times before . the real-life characters from the theater group harldy fare better when portrayed : the bland marc blitzstein ( hank azaria ) , who says he is not a communist but a homosexual ( but the point being made is that homosexuals are viewed just as badly as the commies are ) . they both gave forgettable performances . there are intertwined stories around the theater about the industrialists mixing with the fascists . these scenes could have been even more potently dramatic , if the miscast cusack was replaced by someone who could do a better rockefeller . at one point nelson says , " i must confess that i'm more interested in the oil in paint than the oil in derricks . " you've got to find a way to give them a dollar -- and take two ! " vanessa redgrave , in a stereotyped role , is gray's lightheaded , titled wife , countess la grange , with liberal aspirations and sympathy for the theater people . all these parts seem oversimplified , with the director pulling the strings as if the actors were puppets , and though the message is right-on , there was no immediacy or impact in the story . there was no art in the art , everything moved along predictably . i imagine that someone with much more political savvy and more experience directing than robbins , like mike leigh , could have found a way to get around this mess without altering where the sympathies should lie to pull off a more satisfying work . the cast and the audience then trekked uptown through the streets and saw the show there . there was no scenery , there was just blitzstein at the piano , and the play made history with a most thrilling and memorable opening . but , ultimately , politics aside , the trouble with the original play became what was the trouble with this movie version , the story and the music are just too dry , though the message it presents , is worth savoring . but , any film that can quote nelson rockefeller and also leave no mistake where those other industrial patrons of the arts stood , makes me recommend this well-intentioned but flat dramatic film solely on that basis . ah !
rating:1 rita hayworth has a bit part as a servant , while stepin fetchit plays his usual stereotyped role--this might be offensive to some . this was a lackluster suspense story , which at times seems more like a horror film ; and , the actors didn't distinguish themselves . but the film gave off some egyptian charm , those borrowed from a long list of hollywood b-movies .
rating:2 a poignant , original , psychological drama-comedy depicting life among a bunch of disorientated residents in vancouver . his schoolwork also suffers because of his deep sexual problem . he makes good use of leigh's improvisational way of shooting a film and has created a nifty contemporary film , with frighteningly real sex scenes and recognizable characters who have modern urban problems . the acting is subtle ( babz chula's performance is mesmorizing ) , while , the story , though not reliant on plot , is emotionally strong , showing how all the individuals are tangled up in knots . it was both a sad and funny picture , one that i would highly recommend for those who are not afraid of seeing some very graphic , 'dirty' sexual scenes , that fit the story to a tee .
rating:1 what we have , is a very cleverly done film , that is in it for the box-office and as an entertainment only film , and it should accomplish both aims , at least , entertainment wise , it is first-rate . it is a good mindless , violent flick for americans to take their mind off the more serious things occuring at the time this movie opened , such as the political scandal and impeachment hearings involving our prez and his lady intern ( and , you know how serious that stuff was ) . but do remember , the bad hero , is not all that bad , he is mel , the charming hero of countless adventure films , a guy who is full of good looks and charm , someone audiences love to like , and will plunk down their money to see his films in huge numbers . he also does the voice-over ala noir style , in a deep laconic voice , you know , like a sam spade would do it . the voice-over reassured me that he will live through the film ( that's good , because knowing him , he will be in every scene of this flick , and therefore i'm assured that i will be getting my money's worth of mel . you see , i don't really care what happens to his character in this flick , per se , since he is as unreal as the ones you find in the cartoons . what i care about is being entertained , by golly , golly , golly , gee ! ) . payback rips off the way a noir film is shot and looks , ( or maybe , in a certain sense , pays it homage ! ! ! ) and does it with pizzazz . the big city it chooses for its locale is chicago , with its tall buildings and el trains , adding a dark shade to its story . the only thing it fails to pick up from those great b/w films mood pieces of edginess from the 40s and 50s , is that their heroes were really underdogs , they were fighting the system , not out for their own ends and vanity only . this little difference is easy to ignore , but it is bothersome when i see how close mel came to sniffing out the essence of a noir film . but i'm glad to report , ever so close , but no cigar , tough guy . you just can't imitate that secret ingredient without being into the real thing . you were both great to look at on screen , you played your hands well , and most importantly , i enjoyed the film , it had a lightness to it that made it very appealing . needless to say , there was not much to the plot for this stylish film , but for those of you who want to know the story line , this is a pure revenge film . action scenes of this heist are super . this gag lends a much welcomed humor to what could have been just a pointless actioner . at least , the filmmakers are having fun with this one , and it shows . for the remainder of this slick film , porter is either getting beat up or doing the beatings himself . there is plenty of action , so don't worry you don't have to think of anything when you are watching this flick , everything moves at break-neck speed . these filmmakers have a great eye for detail . so , all-in-all , you have a lot of good action scenes going down , a lot of funny one-liners ( i laughed out loud when porter said , if i was any dumber i would have become a cop . you see , porter is acting very dumb going after the mob and its big bosses , kristofferson , coburn , and devane ) . i , especially , liked seeing devane , he is a throwback to the old noir foils . there is also an homage scene or a rip off , which ever you prefer , it doesn't matter to me , when porter rips the earring off a drug dealer's ear , taking a chunk of his ear with it . you can't help remembering roman polansky did that in chinatown , a true modern noir film , a film that caught the essence of that genre . the film works for all the above reasons , and most of all it works , because mel is great for the part .
rating:2 this is fundamentally a feminist oriented road movie without the politics of the movement playing a part in the story , as the film is steeped in personal irony over abandonment of loved ones and fantasies that can't become real , without any particular message to deliver , except that these two have their hands full coping with their life , as it seems , it is only by their humor and forceful spirit that they can manage to survive . since they consider themselves artists , they feel their act speaks for itself and are particularly upset at being blind sided by one hostile viewer of their show , an overweight lady who feels that they made fun of how obese women look in their act and she felt they did a disservice to women who have that problem , as she upsets them as she rails at them before walking out . since the family treats him as someone not to be taken seriously , yet it is quite evident , that he , alone , has a real love for something that the bourgeois in his family just don't have . a chocolate salesman tells them every one is an actor trying to sell their product , but the important thing is , if you try hard enough people will forgive you for what you are lacking or might not even notice it . that his gimmick is to get the children to eat the chocolate first , then the parents are delighted that the kids like the chocolate , so his sale becomes an easy one . though , what stands out , is the marvelously genuine performances of the heroines of the story and how appealing they were in such a troublesome way , that there public appearance might seem calm and collected , but behind the scenes they are being gnawed at by all the chaos in their life . this thought provoking film , touched many different themes with equal breath and veracity , but this also highlighted its most glaring weakness , that it couldn't focus in on any one theme completely , as it mostly questioned middle-class values and the need for a person to find a way to express themselves enthusiastically , pointing out that maybe , that is all one can hope for , yet leaving so many other things unanswered that it brought up , that you could write your own movie from all that was left unsaid that remains speculative about the girls and their situation .
rating:1 a chic modern vampire tale that is visually pleasing in its presentation but its scattered storyline seemed anemic , as it wavers between a love and horror story . it also offers a facile philosophy tract on good and evil ( the chinese director studied philosophy in england ) , as the director takes a stab at making this film into a religious fable about finding the truth . that i take to be the film's heavy statement , as it comes between the vampire's long stares , heavy breathing sounds , and gushy looks at his women vics before he sates himself on their blood . it was a strange and stylishly modern vampire tale that is set in london , that tried to be ever so cute and succeeded mostly in being enigmatic and weirdly captivating as both a thriller and a romance story . the relationship between the cop and the suspect was grounded in reality and had the only dialogue in the film that wasn't risible . their perfect love is interrupted by some ridiculous dialogue between them , especially the one about the theory of three-brains . the film isn't good when it comes to following the script , it seems pleasing only because of the visually chilling atmosphere it presents . this is the kind of delicate horror film with artsy pretensions that has law tell the pale looking l ? wensohn , that he needs the love that is in her blood . there were too many lines like that for me to be pleased with the film overall , as it seemed to me that it wished it could be more campy and funny yet it foolishly took itself to be a serious drama . there was something comical in its blood that it couldn't quite get out of its bloodstream . he lacks a specific component in his blood without which he will die . a good premise does not necessarily lead to a good script , and that's what does this hazy puzzler in : the beautiful looking film just doesn't make sense and can't be explained away by such weak attempts at philosophizing .
rating:2 his slow but steady transformation into political awareness is the most reassuring omen sent out in this non-didactic , straight forward ambitious project of sayles . the strength that comes from such a story , is in the telling of it and the powerful images presented . the problem with all this , is that since no specific country was named , it must mean that sayles considers this to be a universal problem , and that makes the problem gigantic , with no one to be specifically blamed , especially since these kind of human abuses have been going on for ages , it becomes difficult to zero in on what can be done to prevent such happenings . the other problem is that one can get the feeling that there reaches a point where one feels he is being manipulated , that there is so little that can be done by individuals alone , that governments have to be held accountable for their actions , and people have to be aware of what their governments are doing , even if , most of all , people have to learn how to help themselves . this is a very strong , independent minded picture , that chooses to tell a very difficult story , one that not many people will take comfort in . but the question arises as to how the message of such despair will get out to people who are so far removed from that isolated part of the world . it seems that this film might have some influence , but there is little that individuals who are not from that region can do , as proof we have just to look at the terrors faced by those in this film who tried to help . dennis schwartz : movie reviews ozus @sover . net
rating:2 but in robert altman's gentle and perceptive comedy , this is not enough . appropriately enough , this is a film set in the fall , and the mood and the color of the film reflects that time of year , in all its beauty and in its surprisingly stormy weather . she is baffled by her problem , but surmises it's a rare mythological complex that she suffers from , that affects only upper-class women who are loved too much and come to reject this love , retreating into a childlike state . she concurs that if anyone would know , it's him . at last , after many recent bombs , gere has found a film that goes hand in hand with his laconic style and intelligent grace , as he plays a sympathetic character , someone who seems very comfortable with this dazzling role around so many women and comes across as a good doctor and a generous person who is trying his best to be the man around a sea of women . there doesn't seem to be much tragedy here , it seems that script writer anne rapp and the 75-year-old altman are only gently chiding the doctor for thinking he can ever understand women , and the film plays more like a big joke on him than anything else . what unravels for him , are all things he can easily rebound from , as the film ends with the song " ain't it something the way things go " being played as the credits roll by , after an unpredictable ending to a sweetly bizarre film .
rating:1 larry cohen's auspicious debut film is a scathing black comedy set in beverly hills . there seemed to be a break down in society and cohen isn't interested in why but in what is happening to the country . but he lets the suspense go to pieces and eases the heavy rape scene with social comedy and gentrified manners . it is sordidly funny in spots and at other times it just seems shrill and pretentious . there were too many flat spots between the mesmerizing opening scene around the swimming pool and the bleak finale in a sand dune , to make this quirky effort work entirely . it seemed to be toying with the audience for its acceptance or disapproval , more than anything else . bone is a film desperately trying to get under one's skin , but doesn't have enough staying power to complete the job , except it leaves one with a lingering feeling of being unduly provoked and still laughing about it . it fits nicely into cohen's concept of film as schlock art . cohen will split the screentime with bill and bernadette at this point . bone had its moments in the sun , but couldn't get out of its shadow in time to say more than boo ! what remains chewy about it , is the bizarre psychology evoked . it is a film that will be pleasing to some much more than it will be to others ; it could be admired for its originality and for its quirkiness , but there are others who might see it strictly as an exploitive film . the film had moments when it was both terribly good and terribly raunchy .
rating:2 a solid psychological suspense yarn that plays like a modern noir , but one that comes to a screeching dead-end after its subject matter becomes exhausted and it decides to solve its moral dilemma with bullets instead of with the mind . it's a smart film with weighty dialogue to bring the story to the height of its dilemma in such a crisp way . what keeps the film compelling is the shaded introspective performance by macy who ably anchors the film , as he allows us to see who and what he is ; and , more importantly what suffering he is now going through . sutherland's performance is devilishly demonic , and in his understated call for violence gives voice to a very scary character who gets under our skin . bain's complicity with sutherland adds to the psychological trauma of the macy character . in contrast to the men , neve campbell's performance is loud and reaching . as a character-driven film , it is handled with a quiet reassurance by first-time director but experienced screenwriter henry bromell . panic plays like an episode for homicide does that has become more invigorated with psychological possibilities . bromell , the homicide cop-show writer , has made a tv cop drama come to life as a b movie that can't get away from tv's weakness of hanging a moral ending onto its dramatics . but , nevertheles , i still found it to be a hit man movie with a heart and a brain , a film that keeps a low profile while taking you on a mind trip laced with bitter irony .
rating:2 carol reed's breakthrough film as a director after a long and undistinguished film career . are just trying to figure out what to do that is right . he does not care that he would only be healing johnny so that the fugitive could be executed . that only help given without expecting something from it , is truly a christian charity . londoner reed has shot a pro-british film , that is stronger on being a suspenseful art film than an accurately political one . the dark rainy streets of belfast and the brooding mood of mason , made this film look much like a noir feature . it is preachy in spots , trying to show many different sides to the struggle , where characters along the way seem more like symbols than real flesh-and-blood . but the film was very weak in setting up the political arguments that caused the civil war in the first place , as no rational person will disagree with the film's anti-violent stance . but there is a lot going on that the film left uncovered from the point of view of what the revolutionaries are protesting . i found the film , nevertheless , absorbing , especially as a thriller--a 'cops and robbers' tale .
rating:2 a snappy b-film thriller , excellently paced for broad sweeps of comedy and fright . lew ayres stars in a film he says in a magazine interview , " is the kind of picture actors do when they need work . " basil rathbone , who was a big star at the time of this film , had a small part as the villain . ayres is endearing as the misunderstood actor who will only be with a woman who doesn't lie . together they make an engaging couple , bringing a wonderful sense of lightness to their roles . the story is as clear as mud , but the performances from the stars was sparkling . and , even though the film might be dated , it's still a lot of fun .
rating:2 the first-time director does a great job of establishing character in this ensemble production and fully catches the rigors of a working-class milieu , also catching the need for dignity walken has and how the other characters bounce off his understated performance to complement it with their own particular tics . donal logue seems like he's a real guy from the neighborhood , his performance was so real it didn't seem like it was a performance . vera farmiga is as sweet as pie and seemed a natural as the caring daughter . what's there not to like about this robbery ! it is hard for the audience to not root for them to succeed in this victimless caper . it is a film with limited aims , but it has a certain friendliness and charm to it , that credit must go in no small measure to the fine cast and the good eye the director has for what a real neighborhood is like and how working-class people feel . there is a certain grace to this movie , that i think jean-pierre melville would have attested to and welcomed walken into his noir films , as someone bob the gambler would have taken a shine to . the first-time director does a great job of establishing character in this ensemble production and fully catches the rigors of a working-class milieu , also catching the need for dignity walken has and how the other characters bounce off his understated performance to complement it with their own particular tics . donal logue seems like he's a real guy from the neighborhood , his performance was so real it didn't seem like it was a performance . vera farmiga is as sweet as pie and seemed a natural as the caring daughter . what's there not to like about this robbery ! it is hard for the audience to not root for them to succeed in this victimless caper . it is a film with limited aims , but it has a certain friendliness and charm to it , that credit must go in no small measure to the fine cast and the good eye the director has for what a real neighborhood is like and how working-class people feel . there is a certain grace to this movie , that i think jean-pierre melville would have attested to and welcomed walken into his noir films , as someone bob the gambler would have taken a shine to . ozus@sover . net
rating:1 the problem with the film , as an original and diverting story as it is , is that it is also too confusing to follow and suffers from a sense that it is too " hip " for its own good . but even as the film failed to add up to being as good as it could have been , it was still entertaining and visually engaging . i began to enjoy the film more for its style , which is the only way to view it . it was shot in such exacting detail , its colorful sets becoming a feast for the eyes that were ready to experience visions not seen in other sci-fi films , it also allowed for a certain pleasure to be induced from overhearing the odd conversations that were inane but fun to listen to . fox's haiku is a good example of the meaningful nonsense the film conveyed , as he recites to x the poem he just wrote : but something mysterious soon happens and the last 20 minutes of the film repeats what happened so far , but adding new details and a different way of looking at it . the murky ending will not be pleasing to most viewers , as they try to make sense of what is happening .
rating:2 this is her favorite role in her personal favorite movie . he instigated this move she wasn't that crazy about , but went along with it the best way she could . sigourney mentioned that this is an unusual and uplifting film , though the unusual nature of the film is easy to see , as this gritty dramatic film takes a conventional soap opera story about a nuclear family and makes it into a moving drama where the characters are forced to look at themselves again and undergo changes they didn't expect . the uplifting part was harder to see and just might be up to the individual to find what is meant by uplifting . it was a difficult film to come up with easy answers , as it required some thought to sift through the many layers of the characters . there's also the constant noise and lack of privacy to deal with . unfortunately there was one scene that was baked over too fine : that would be the jail scene with alice eventually winning over the hardened cons . it seemed contrived and the film spent too much prison time , as it said everything it had to say about the dehumanizing effect jail has in its opening shot when she was booked and everything else seemed reduntant . also , the last scene felt flat . i find it hard to believe that was an uplifting scene as much as it was one that put an exclamation point on the situation , visually indicating that things are still tenuous for the family and even though they have gone over one terrible hurdle and are perhaps psychologically stronger because of it--they are still not out of the dark . but , then again , if you find that uplifting you'll get no argument from me . the film is directed by scott elliott , making his film debut after being known for his broadway work and as the artistic director of the new group ; the film is more ambiguous than pat , which is not necessarily a bad thing . elliott also does a great job of drawing out an outstanding performance from sigourney weaver . it was a part that should have been expanded and it weakened the film by instead padding it with stale prison and courtroom scenes that many films have done before . nevertheless , this is still a high quality drama , especially recognizing sigourney weaver's tour de force performance of a complex woman who is a little off-kilter . that should be rewarding enough for those who crave intelligent 'mom in trouble' dramas . i unhestatingly recommend the film for the way it intelligently examines the family crisis--though it's not for everyone , as the casual viewer might not be interested in a serious film that can be disturbing when a toddler is taken off a respirator . the film played at the williamstown film festival .
rating:2 skarsgard's chilling performance does a pyschological number on his character , and the mysterious and soberly colorful norwegian atmosphere gives this film an appealing flavor , allowing it to appear as if were a noir film . this more than makes up for the less than appealing story line . it is worth a look , if for no other reason , than to see how a murder is handled in a beautiful and idyllic country such as norway . but this film has more to offer than that ; it seriously questions police conduct and authority , as it leaves a very damaging message , something that is hard to ignore about authority figures the world-over : questioning if the police are mentally fit for the work they do .
rating:3 a top-rate film noir from the master , alfred hitchcock , that is more or less a twisted tale about love . it's also more erotic than the usual hitchcock ones , as long kissing scenes are duly noted . in fact , one scene was supposedly " the longest kiss onscreen in the history of films , '' taking three minutes in all . it was not , however , a single kiss , but broken up in three second intervals as censors observed . this memorable scene is in a class with the final one in casablanca .
rating:2 i felt like i was being one-lined to a loving death in this elegant oscar wilde comedy/drama costume play turned movie , and i must confess , i enjoyed every bit of the intelligence and the wit and the frivality of it , as this tremendous ensemble cast fired away with a continuous volley of epigrams . it is a modern play , even though it is one that was written in the last century for an audience that was more or less reflective of the characters portrayed on stage . for the elite audience that attended the play , oscar wilde , after mocking the english nobility would , at least , leave them with a thinly disguised compliment , by telling them no one can be ideal . the film was put to screen by the manipulative wizardry of miramax ( shakespeare in love , the wings of the dove ) , who know from the success of some of their recent films quite well how to popularize an already popular literary work by broadening its emotional appeal . they gave the audiences what they wanted , a film that has a romantic heart in it and is not just hilariously flippant , and they should be commended for improving an imperfect but successful play . it rarely happens when a commercial venture turns out to critically improve a work of so called " art , " so when it does happen , it should be shouted from the highest mountain peaks . everything is thoroughly enjoyable and agreeable about this wonderfully delightful work of subtle wit and brilliant dialogue . rupert everett stands out as a sheer delight in a cast that is almost perfect ( julianne moore could have been a tad more sinister ) . everett's role is one that he relishes in , as he says of himself , " i love talking about nothing , it's the only thing i know anything about . " minnie driver is simply bubbling over with charm and wit to match his . their flirtations are one of dueling wits , with amusing lunges and enough double-entendres to get through any intellectual armor worn . there are so many witty phrases to revel in , but my favorite one is when lord goring says , " morality is only for those you don't like . " writer/director oliver parker ( othello ) has created a lighthearted film for all audiences who love the spoken word as if it were a treasure and who find the intrigues of high society to be invigorating .
rating:1 a fine example of a 1940s type of film noir , as adapted from a cornell woolrich novel . the acting was commendable and the development of the dark noir world was very well established ; but , the case itself seemed hardly believable-- the dialogue was atrocious , and the crazed , genius killer looking down at his hands and getting dizzy spells was more ridiculous than a truthful presentation . the film had too many defects that just couldn't be overlooked , yet overall it had a mesmerizing effect--largely due to the imaginative direction robert siodmak gave it .
rating:1 this is an awkward comedy made just before kurosawa's breakthrough film , rashomon . but hiruta is not reliable , as he explains himself , saying people used to take advantage of him and laugh at his weaknesses , so he now uses trickery on them and doesn't care about ethics . the film switches tracks , as the two leads are not particularly interesting types , but the flawed hiruta makes for a more compelling story , so he becomes the main focus of the film . the courtroom is filled with contrivances , as the story befits a tacky soap opera . you can't beat that for pouring on the goo ! supposedly this film is a parody of the japanese willingness to accept america's foreign culture as theirs . kurosawa is an overrated director outside of shooting an action film , who can't shoot a dramatic film without laying on an overdose of goo . here he has mifune and the concert singer become sexless , while the publisher becomes a stock cardboard villain , and the lawyer's fall and redemption are just too predictable to have any effect . there is something caustic in this story , but its overall effect is ruined by too much that is an obvious delineation of what is good and evil . i found the message awkwardly delivered and unconvincing , and the acting was especially bad , as the lines as rendered seemed to be mechanical and not instinctive , it was as if all the actors attended a school for bad actors and learned to act by being didactic . this film hardly had a pulse , just a message it kept sending out in a not too subtle way .
rating:0 you see , this mr . perfect turns out to be a madman . he exhibits signs of being a control freak , someone who might even be a nut case , by taking everything so literal and acting in a robotic and deliberate fashion when he speaks , so that everything he does seems out of place . in fact , the acting in the film by everyone is really fine , especially considering how thin the script was . it is the story itself and the way it is directed that leads to the detriment of the film , allowing it to have the look of one of those films made only to be seen as a rental video , which indeed is how this film was released . the film tries to play like noir , but only ends up being the kind of fake noir that is more irritating than complimentary . it tries to be purposefully evasive about its storyline and to have its tenuous story be based on chance as being the sole determinant of life . what it eventually becomes is a predictable psycho flick and not an unpredictable noir film , as it wanted to be . it has trapped itself into being a film without a plot , with rotten dialogue , and a fake means of maintaining tension . it tries so hard to give itself a weird angle through its characterizations , which only work on a superficial level-from the neurotic damsel-in-peril , plummer- to the split personality performance of forster , whose actions waiver between maniacally calm reasoning to histrionic schmaltz , as he goes off the deep end reciting rhymes . the main problem , which the film is never able to overcome , is that the storyline is not that compelling and that the characters are not necessarily interesting even if they are quirky . the story never had a real strength to it ; it always seemed like the actors were play-acting , that the script was struggling to device another gimmick to go with the coin toss motif , instead of letting the story seem to come about out of its own accord . this did not help explore anything going on inside the characters , only trivializing the story further , making it rely solely on a gimmick to tell its story . what we are left with is a series of encounters among characters who are not that appealing in the first place , and also by the end of the film , we know only a little more about the psychopath than we did from the opening scene . i therefore wasn't sure what the director wanted to accomplish , except he probably thought by showing how idiosyncratic all the characters could be , that would be enough to get it over . if that was what he was thinking , he misjudged the quality of the film , but not before he showed flashes of talent here and there , for example , in the opening scene in the desert --- forster's calm demeanor was played-off beautifully against plummer's nervous energy , and with the desert lurking as a hostile backdrop to the action , it added a thrilling surreal sense of dramatics to the story . but the film fell too quickly into the serial-killer mode , and lost the edge it never had but always wanted .
rating:1 a 'b' movie political thriller , that was shrewd enough to get newsreel footage of the royal family and the cabinet attending the opening of parliament into its closing action scenes . the weak script and uninspiring dialogue , is compensated for by the crisp action sequences and fast pacing of the story . the revengeful hennessy has a one-track mind , never revealing anything about his character or why he should snap in this way and come up with such a ludicrous scheme , as the one he has hatched . this is one of those films that doesn't add up if you think about it . the film hopes to get by because of the taut acting jobs of its lead characters and by the semi-documentary glossy black-and-white look its color tinted film has , giving it a natural and gritty feel . but the film's ending has so many holes in its planning , that the film seems incredulous and the points it make seem dull , and its suspense is not that nerve wracking either , since you can almost bet your house that the filmmakers are not going to have the loony hennessy blow up parliament . the best things one can say about the film , was that the acting wasn't bad and it was watchable even if it was not a very believable story .
rating:1 if you like nonsense musicals with plenty of singing , beautiful set designs , fantastic colors , sex , witchcraft , and a fairy tale charm to it , then you will probably like this film , which is in many ways like flying down to rio . though , i was hoping it could be more like those jacques demy or jacques rivette musicals , exhibiting a little more substance . but if you are in a mood for some light entertainment , this zany musical has plenty of oomph and should satisfy your latino appetite for something that is easy and sexy to look at . the little known director of this film , hails from venezuela , which gives this french film a very natural latin twist to its story and music . the this is all done as harmless and silly fun , much in the vein of a long list of hollywood and french musicals , films that i was never partial to . for what it's worth , this film is an entertaining and colorful spectacle , and with enough verve in it to make it seem inventive .
rating:2 say anything . . . first-time director cameron crowe who was to go on and make many successful films ( singles/jerry maguire ) , including his latest " almost famous , " gives his due respect to these teenage characters , whose character are rarely treated in such films in such a plausible human way . that alone is enough to make this a superior film , but besides that , the film was superbly scripted and acted , with tremendous use of the characters interacting in a real way . finally , we have a teen film that doesn't dumb down its story line and play it as a goofy teen film . the important thing here is that everyone was presented in a real way , even the irs agents were given more than one dimension , and therefore it meant something to see how the relationship between the teenage couple developed .
rating:3 one of the all time fun pictures , with enough ingredients in it to please a wide variety of film fans . this was english actor claude rains' american movie debut and vehicle to future stardom , even though he is visible for probably less than 30 seconds of the film , and that comes only at the film's climax , who only got the role because boris karloff turned it down , afraid that the role wouldn't work for him because he wouldn't be seen : but rains' distinctive voice was all that was needed to bring credibility to the part he will always be remembered for . a film so perfectly and magically done , that is based on the h . g . wells novel , that is faithful to the book while adding its own flavor of campiness to the story , such as a wonderfully bizarre una o'connor , screaming her head off , as " the lion's head " inn's wife of the owner and hostess to the invisible man . a special film such as this one , brings unmitigated joy to those of the 20th century who like to sit in the dark and watch a world of illusions come across a screen , an activity that could have hardly been envisioned a couple of thousand years ago , and is looked upon , even today , with a strange reserve by those who don't take their movies that seriously , not understanding just how rewarding it is for those who find certain films so important to them , that it becomes an integral part of their life and they can see the same film over and over again and still derive great satisfaction in what they are seeing . as for me , i could have seen this film as many as twenty times already , starting when i was 12-years-old and first saw it on a tv program called " the million dollar movie , " and i still get a kick out of it and see something delightfully new in it with each viewing . it is especially fun to watch it with youngsters who have never seen it before and are generally unfamiliar with watching a movie in b/w , just to watch the reaction you get from these youngsters , is enough of a charge , as they are perhaps surprised at the fun they are having in watching such a creaky story and its outdated hollywood version of an old established english country village . it is a film like this one , that can lure you into becoming a bona fide film buff . he is dressed so you can't see one feature of him , as he is wrapped in facial bandages and wearing a hat and an overcoat , rubber gloves and sun goggles . the gifted director james whale knew what to do with this story , as his serious sounding but humorous caveat throughout the film is : there are certain things on earth man must not meddle in . dr . kemp is scared out-of-his wits , and the scene is filled with pathos , melodrama , and ironical wit , as griffin dresses in his unwilling guest's robe and pajama's and usual bandage disguise , and explains to him that his invisibilty is not perfect , after eating his food it could be seen for an hour afterwards , until it is fully digested , that in the cold air you could see his breath , in the rain he would look like a bubble , that he has trouble walking down stairs as an invisible man , because he hasn't quite gotten used to the fact that he is invisible and therefore is very cautious of the downward steps he takes . but how do you capture an invisible man ? the film comes to its splendid climax in the dreaded snow , with john fulton's ultra-modern , for its day , special effects , adding enormous visual support to the sci-fi story , having the invisible man's footprints remarkably appear in the snow .
rating:2 this was a revolution the director was a supporter of , but has now gotten into trouble with the censors because of his film's contents . the film was unique , honest , raw , and daring . makhmalbaf shows a great passion for dealing with the ironies of modern iran .
rating:1 it is a darkly violent film that fails to be dramatically engaging , but has its brief moments of edification as it satisfactorily points out how each side harmed innocent citizens in their fight and what ultimately the union victory meant for the country . but the film could not present a coherent plot , as it seemed to shrivel up as the story dragged on after its colorful battle scenes . taking the southern side , the film found humor in the awkward situations presented and found beauty in the landscape photographed , and reasons in the southern cause which doomed them to failure . but many things about the film seemed to be perfunctory and more like a costume show where the soldiers were more interested in showing off the plumage on their cowboy hats than in giving a dramatic presentation . this explains a key weakness of the southern cause , according to the filmmaker , that the southern values are tradition-bound and part of a static culture . they have been spending their time having longwinded unnatural conversations that sound much like sermons , so sue lee's intrusion is more than welcome at this time . though this is a technically correct and serious movie and tries to cover a controversial topic in an intelligent way , yet the presentation of the story didn't seem to always jell . it was a dull film , the acting was misplaced , the story was too distant and the dialogue was stilted . it never got around to being an entertaining film , and it could never be perceived as just an informative film , because it could never quite spit out what it was trying to say . i also found tobey maguire's performance grimacing to take--this was the wrong part and film for him to go through his innocent contortions that he has done in all his previous films .
rating:1 the audience is not told what that question was , except that one student says , as he recovers one of the many paper planes flown with the same question written on it , " it's corny . " in truth , those comments crossed my mind about many aspects of this film , as i waivered about my feelings toward the story , as spellbinding as the overall film was , because the story , in parts , did feel " corny . " medem makes a symbolic point about relating the children's lives to a circle , where there is no real ending or beginning to their story . there are several other symbolic devices that are used by medem a bit more obtusely ( like empty gas tanks ) , and one of those images might even be considered prophetic , the repeated image shown of a car stopping short of a collision with a red bus . the solid story is befuddled with versions showing how the imagination of the two differs from the supposed reality of the story , which should leave the audience scratching their heads to try and figure out what is actually happening . the story stretches the coincidences to a point of incredibility and becomes more tainted with its philosophical message than a typical romance film usually is , as medem carries out the argument that both reality and fiction can be likened to a series of circles that interconnect through the efforts of coincidences that may not make sense to our mortal eyes , but these circles are present , in either physical places or in events taking place in one's life . as you might suspect by now , this film is not going to be clearly resolved . why should it be at this point , it has teased the audience from the opening scene onward and there is no reason why the ending shouldn't also be speculative . though , even in this type of traditional hollywood ending that has pleased movie goers of romantic films for generations now , the director has his doubts if there is any state of being that can be permanent . in the final shot , there is a picture of otto in her eyes . which one is the true version probably doesn't matter , as the director will allow you to believe whatever you want to . if you are interested in my guess , it would be the later version , the story seems to flow in that direction . most people i know , were put off by this slick ending , and question the filmmaker's real intentions for playing with the audience like this . as for me , it wasn't the ending that bothered me about this breathlessly beautiful film , with its stunning shot of the midnight sun and of the arctic wildlands , as much as the story getting lost in trying to be too fanciful , playing with my expectations for things to work out for these amenable lovers and then not delivering any firm message but what seems to be at first glance , only , a pretentiously philosophical one . and , by not staying on target with the romantic part of the story , but drifting around in circles , where the coincidences are just too much for any two people to experience in a lifetime , the film becomes marginalized and makes it seem like a philosophy exercise , albeit an absorbing one , but one that is , nevertheless , less dramatic and more melodramatic than it should be . but what i found strangely pleasant about the film , was that even though i was somewhat put off by the tricks employed throughout the story , i still found myself caught up in the dynamics of the characters and how commonplace their lives were , that is , if you could discount all the chance encounters . this made me realize that it didn't matter if this film wasn't going to meet my expectations about what should be happening or if its philosophy was overtly too oblique ; the film had a special quality about it that got its message across despite being off target . victor hugo oliveira , as the teenage otto , twisted up inside by the strange love relationship he is going through , was delivering a sensitive performance , as this relationship was intriguing , dangerously close to being incestuous , but was one that was not clarified any further , to the detriment of the film but to no fault of the actor . therefore , the startling ending to the film became less important to comprehend , because the heart of the film wasn't explored as much as it should have been . the strangeness of this film , is that its haunting use of language and visuals to fill in the blanks for the characters , still overshadows its melodramatic story and keeps the pot boiling , even when you might think the film is skiing lumberingly uphill instead of gracefully downhill and is about to slip and slide downhill in a crackup . but that never happens because the film has a special elusive quality about it that original films seem to always have . thusly , i felt caught up in the film's magical spell despite the many reservations i had about the manipulations the director used , as he ultimately proved that he has weaved a tale about the darkened lovers and their near-misses and made it into a tale of haunting characterizations , leaving something mysterious about this intangible and intelligent film that held my undivided attention throughout .
