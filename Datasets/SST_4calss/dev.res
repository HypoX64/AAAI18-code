rating:0 obviously there is no such a place as pleasantville , except in a sitcom . pleasantville is a film about how selective one's memory is when it comes to nostalgia , of pining for values that never existed back then but still are the values exemplified for the traditional family , of the resistance to change , and clashes between those in the film who become " colored " and those who remain in " black-and-white , " and about the need to be an individual and not conform . it's fairly predictable what will happen once the two realize that they are transformed into an unreal tv world , as the film prepares to go into its satire mold and take apart the blandness of such perfection . the filmmaker then analyzes these changes on those newly affected and the result is a more troubled but more interesting people emerging . through special effects from digital processing , flowers start taking on color and the film begins to have a modern-day " alice in wonderland " look to it . j . t . there was something that rubbed me the wrong way about this " cute " idea of a film , besides the fact it was boring and i felt as if i was being lectured to about the obvious general ills of society . there are no radical new ideas presented in this film that will make me really think about these issues any differently than the films of the 1950s would have ; it is as if the filmmaker is saying that 1950s didn't have films that were critical of society : but a list of such films would be very extensive ( marty , high noon , ace in the hole , etc . ) . this snooty attitude , looking down at the past from the vantage point of a supposedly " hip " new age bothered me . afterall , my impression of this film , is that it really is a 1950s sitcom merging with a 1990s " feel good " type of sitcom , and nothing more . it is basically , a gimmicky film , which is the only new ground it breaks , selling an idea about the past that connects it with the present , but doing it at the expense of telling the truth about neither the past or present . the film is trying to say that the innocence of the 1950s must be merged with the social awareness of the 1990s and this can only be accomplished by the teenage heroes , who are not afraid to take chances and change the times they're in . i just didn't buy into this premise and was not convinced that i wasn't seeing anything but a superficial film . character development is a raising of consciousness that comes about only through a real inward awareness , a book can only act as a catalyst for that experience . what is offered movie-wise , is just the kind of empty gestures made to genuine problems , which can be found on tv programs from both yesterday and today . therefore it is just another empty gesture at culture , trying to be cute , letting the baby boomers know that it's okay , there're doing just fine . you can keep being materialists , just be cool about it ! there was no one in this film who understood how to bridge the past with the future , instead this becomes a film just like the sitcoms it parodies , which means it's just another escape film , unable or unwilling to delve deeply into all the real problems it brings up .
rating:1 the 81-year-old boris karloff's last completed feature film , could have and should have been better , as it suffers from a weakly-crafted script despite having great performances from the three prominent horror screen favorites who are in it- that would be karloff as professor marshe , christopher lee as morley , and barbara steele as lavinia . though , it is still worth seeing because of its star attractions and its innovative psychedelic offerings to the horror genre . bob scoffs at the witch story and the idea of ghosts being around , saying he knows little about such things . but the professor replies in his noted serious karloff movie tone , " when the time comes , your skepticism might be only a fragile shield . " bob's conversations with the wheel-chaired bound professor are terse but highlight the film , as they are delivered with proper horror film affect . the film's not real frightening because there is a flatness to it ; but , it has its entertaining moments , and is a must see for karloff fans .
rating:1 this version of browning's poem is well-told and sensible , and probably a lot like he meant it to be conveyed , but somehow it looks flat on screen , like it was a b movie , and this is surprising , since demy is really a great director . but , evidently , something went terribly wrong here . the film is so flatly done , it was as if i was watching the machine-like actors go through the motions of acting out a chilling story , that when it came out on screen had lost its chills , even if the story itself remained chilling .
rating:2 katherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have . to lang's credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook . his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised .
rating:1 all the main characters are coeur d' alene's of idaho . there are many odd characters that add to our awareness of the native american experiences on the reservation , who are both amusing and talkative . but life on the reservation seems stale and confining ; yet , everyone , at least , has some material comforts , as they all seem to live in a house and enjoy their fried bread . film takes on the look of a road film . this is a film written , directed , and acted by native americans . it does not suffer from the usual clich=e9s of indian films , as it artfully weaves a story wavering between despair and comic acceptance of the native american plight . i recommend this film for its verve and very real passion it has for native americans , despite the triteness of its story and the fact that it offered no new insights into child abuse , resolving the father-son relationship only posthumously . i mainly point this out , since one of the major underlying themes of the film , was just that problem .
rating:0 a sensuous romantic comedy , about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom . there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out , its the kind of stuff i've seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny . the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen ? lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can't get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story . pen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var's " all about my mother , " but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face . the best you can say about her , is that she's not to blame for this picture being so off . this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will . we don't see her in flight , so i can't tell how she handled her motion sickness problem -- unless she flew the plane . the show gets so big , that the network honchos come onboard , taking it national . these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos , they were revolting . it was an insult to one's intelligence . i'm sure that i'm not spoiling the ending for anyone , when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again . it was so awkwardly done , that it had no sense of truth or humor to it . this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film , because it doesn't look or feel like an almod ? var film , the type of film it aspired to be , but more like a film that was interferred with from above . its more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic , as it searches for box office heaven .
rating:2 he speaks in a hesitatingly slow , thick southern drawl , and is a very modest , inward man . his life is a difficult one , where his level of discomfort is beyond reasonable expectations . but he is not dull . all the film's energy goes into ian holm's stellar performance . this is a wonderful screen adaption , as scripted by howard a . rodman , who caught the nostalgic and generous mood of greenwich village of the 1940s . ian holm's performance is brilliant and sparkling , one of his best in his long and distinguished career . this cautionary story pictures a city that has changed so much from joe gould's time , that a talented eccentric nowadays should expect to receive no help from a city that is becoming less interested in helping its weirdo artists or its mentally ill , instead turning its attention to more mundane concerns .
rating:1 an atmospheric and most entertaining charlie chan episode . it was the longest charlie chan made at 79 minutes and it was the first one not based on an earl derr biggers book . this film was more a case of charlie chan in the english countryside than in london , but why quibble over a title when the story was so entertaining !
rating:1 it gives the believers in such spiritual transcendence something to cheer about and may give the faithful christians who view the film , a renewed belief in heaven and hell , in god , and in redemption , through the means of a feel-good story , such as this one , that is steeped in religious allegory . the green mile is the most faithful retelling of a stephen king novel ever put to film , and thereby someone like myself who is not a fan of his , is stuck with the popular writer's excesses on film ( he makes me cringe at how scattered his artistic intentions usually turn out to be ) . the message of this film is so muddled and unclear , that there seems to be no point to be made , except how nice most of the people are in this prison . it is a film exploitively showing miracles that an audience might enjoy seeing on the screen , while others might be taken in by the benign mood of the story , others could be enthralled by seeing how the electric chair works , and still others might just like the film for its solid development of its main characters . there was much to like about this implausible thriller , that would have been better served , if it had only been pared down to around an eighty or ninety minute film . darabont spends so much time with a mouse called mr . jingles , who serves no essential need in the story , whose animated antics for the most part bored me . the best thing about the film was its performances , from hank's nice guy guard to duncan's enormous presence to david morse's role as the steady death row prison guard . the actors were all terrific , they couldn't have handled themselves any better , especially since they were dealing with material that was very hard to swallow . the star of the film , though , is an electric chair fondly called " old sparky " by the guards . the filmmaker laboriously goes through the electric chair drill that the guards have before the execution , which made for at least a dull half hour of viewing . but not satisfied with that , the audience is treated to three other electric chair executions and watching all the dull routines the guards go through in their daily work schedule . paul says of him , " the man is mean , careless and stupid--that's a bad combination in a place like this .

rating:1 what can you say about this set in baltimore film , by the king of bad taste , john waters , except it is what can be expected from the director whose type of rebellious childish low-budget indie films have now become passe since his peak days of the 1970s , when he made " pink flamingos . " now his satire has become more tame than outrageous . it is ironic that the director made a film railing about the poor quality of a hollywood film and has made a film that is equally as bad , if not worst . this is a shoddy production , the comedy is lame , the acting almost non-existent , and the satire is sophomoric , taking pop shots at an easy target such as hollywood , but shots that have no sting . if i laughed more , then i could have found some justification for the film . at best , this " demented " could be seen as a tv sketch on " saturday night live , " or a straight to video movie release . as a full-length feature , it ran out of gas shortly after the initial kidnapping scene and went quickly downhill due to a lack of subtlety and the film's inability to be challenging or get at what is really troubling about pop culture . it certainly can't be because the theaters still make popcorn in cocoanut oil and people who go to theaters in the mall talk during the film . demented rants that he is quite willing to die for art and will do anything to make his film . -- to her enthusiasm about changing her image and acting in their film , made for some of the most amusing scenes in the film . the kidnapping scene had some energy in it before even that became tiresome . there was some gentle digs at hollywood : from poking fun at a pauly shore film marathon to the mall showing only " star wars " and " star trek " films to the set of the expensive remake of " forrest gump " being taken over by the guerillas to `les enfants du paradis' panned for being insultingly dubbed in english to mocking the maryland film commission to the " patch adams " film showing of a director's cut in the mall . these were easy targets and the comedy wasn't that funny or radical . it might have been funny on paper but when acted out , it seemed to be mild stuff , things even mainstream films do in a more daring way these days . everyone in the film is bursting at the seams thinking about sex , but cecil has outlawed sex until the movie is completed , so they all live by being sexually frustrated and some are even confused about what kind of sexuality fits them . there's not much to prove by the kidnapping , as the story is really irrelevant . the thing here is if the character can shock you and if the film hit your funny bone . for me , it came up close to empty in all respects . i'll take my deranged films from andy warhol anytime , whose freaks are really freaky and whose stories have more of an edge to them . here , dorff is good enough as the abby hoffman characterization of a punk who has gone completely mental as a deranged artist , while griffith is a good sport , taking in all the remarks about honey's age , her ego-centredness , her tantrums , her phony public demeanor and her defense of the kind of film she made a reputation on as a hollywood star , first defending and then renouncing it . but i wouldn't call her performance acting , as she was mainly around to play a prop of herself to be used as a source for the comedy . the satire was not tough enough to make this a biting film , but rather one that has no claws to scratch and no gumption to really antagonize anyone but the christian right-wing moralists . and since it can still at least do that , no matter how trivial this film is , i guess , the film has a little fire in its belly . . . by the way , water's stated in an interview that the film got its title " cecil b . demented , " because that's what he was called in an early review .
rating:0 you'll need some kind of a pill to sit through this soap opera piece of dreck . become recognized as the ultimate in trash pics . it's a film mired in banality and in a risible dialogue . but broadway doesn't go for booze and dope - now get out of my way , i've got a man waiting for me . " another sample of the film's trite dialogue goes like this : agent : it's a rotten business . neely : " but i love it . " this clich ? -ridden film is as bad as these types of films ever get . but some have embraced it for its campiness . suit yourself ! i can't see a fan of hollywood films ignoring an infamous classic pic like this one forever . it is interesting to note , that all the men the girls become associated with are either : gay , sick , cheats , mean to them , or just plain wimps . that's showbiz i guess , according to the valley of the dolls . you should love the pic's bad acting by everyone except hayward .
rating:2 one of the better sci-fi'ers to emerge from the 1950s . the only part of the film that is in color , is the red letters of the title . no money is taken , only sugar . go figure its ants that did this ! so you can't blame sgt . since the girl's father was a f . b . i . agent on vacation , this makes it a federal crime and the f . b . i . it is these constant little touches throughout the film , more so than the special effects , that make this film come to life . this film was intelligently presented , the special effects were effective enough , and the cast , especially edmund gwenn , all provided fine performances , all this adding up to a really decent and subtle film .
rating:1 an above-par courtroom drama , set in los angeles , elevated by director/screenwriter clifford odets' sharp script . he originally intended for this work to be a play . it was also elevated by an outstanding cast , with special kudos to rita hayworth's warm portrayal of a woman in an abusive marriage and by sanford meisner's forceful and expressive performance as the cross-examing prosecutor . the beauty in the film is in the long-drawn-out courtroom dramatics . the story itself wasn't too interesting , but the performances were energetic and the film had a good courtroom style , enough to make this chatty film well worth seeing .
rating:2 yes . a war zone can be fun for restless teens with hot blood and a passion for mischief . this is a hearfelt film about his coming-of-age during that strife . the 36-year-old filmmaker studied at ucla and was the cameraman for quentin tarantino's pulp fiction and reservoir dogs . but , as riad says , this is our home , there is no other place i would feel comfortable fitting in . the film is not plot oriented , it relies on a bunch of episodic incidents to take place before tarek gets it through his clownish skull and smirking face that this city has changed and won't be the same again . we get a feel for what the director lived through as the friendly tarek is shown relating to his neighbors . the director also presents us with a flavor of the slang language used by the locals , with expressions such as : " you're shish-kabobing me on a small flame ; " or " you drive like steve mcqueen ; " and , about a buxom woman omar says , " what a piece of lamb ! " the film was good at given us a realistic look at how one family looked at those troubled times , rather than for having anything political to say . we are not getting a history lesson here , but a grown man's look back at a period of eight years of his youthful life . the film did this in a rather ordinary way , so that there is nothing deeper to dig out of ziad doueiri's story . it seemed to be a story that the director had to tell , and he shared what he saw with an audience that more than likely only followed the long civil war in the news stories and had no idea how it looked first-hand . this was a film that had no pretenses about it ; it just told the story it knew .
rating:1 a hurricane warning is issued , but because of the poor radio equipment they have , which was not properly repaired by willy , the message is cut off and they don't know how serious that storm will be . but willy's most fatal mistake was to purchase fire extinguishers that were cheap , but would comply in appearance with the air safety codes . it was purchased at the price this airline run on a shoestring could afford , the only trouble was that they were the wrong type of extinguishers for an airplane , and if used , they can cause deadly fumes to be released rather than extinguish the fire . this scares the living daylights out of the prevaricator . her role in the film is never developed , as it is based on a generalization of what someone like her should be like . this kiss is seen by the dismayed pilot . the film's ending is routine formula fare , with a few " predictable " surprises of heroism and villainy , the kind of middling story churned out regularly by the studios who lack the imagination to delve into anything but superficial waters . so what you have is familiary known as a typical disaster b- movie , a precursor to all those other movies of this genre that were very popular with audiences from the late '70s- on . the film fits into the formula mold that studios use over and over again , with the obligatory tense action scenes and the typical danger scenes that call for a hero to be manufactured . you know what i mean , everyone who watches films over the years will run across one like this one , which , by the way , wasn't too bad of a film to watch . the actors had enough vigor in them to keep it going , and the story seemed to move along at a brisk and mindless pace .
rating:1 a taut little suspense programmer . one that is very watchable , though the twist in the plot is hardly believable . it's not believable that a hardened hitman would confess so easily , but he does . . . what this potboiler had going for it , was a nice look to its b&w shots of the dark streets of london , and through sydney tafler's melodramatic performance , it showed how a killer can be cold-blooded taking care of business and yet be a devoted family man and , though his love for his brother was genuine , it was still misguided . overall , the " b " film had good production values and a satisfying but improbable story to tell .
rating:1 petulia plays like a soap opera , set in san francisco during the late 1960s . it has a few gratuitous shots of janis joplin and big brother & the holding company plus the grateful dead , playing to a largely non-hippie audience . it is , indeed , mind-boggling to have so little acid rock in a film pretending to be about the mod '60s . the film reminded me most of a general hospital sudser , with a few noted nicolas roeg cinematography tricks , pre-performance , thrown in to give it a deeper look than the picture merited , such as jump cuts , time frame changes back and forth and forward , leaving one with a disjointed feeling about when events actually took place . the innovations , which make the film seem unconventional , all come about through the visual rhythm of the film rather than through the story itself . the good thing about david's parents , is that the father is joseph cotten and it's always great to hear his uniquely rich voice on the screen . there is no explanation for the continuous flashbacks and flash-forwards , as confusion reigns as a form of hipness . if you ask me , i thought this film was more claptrap than anything else . but enjoyable claptrap . it was easy to take , and even if the story didn't go anywhere , it did catch something unique about the 1960s that wasn't seen in other films -- how the wealthy took to the changes without the usual ways of rebelling . she had a craziness about her that made her pause to take stock of her life , but not enough to be a drop-out . a socialite's kookiness , will you . george c . scott looked grumpy for most of the film , but seemed to gain a little of the revolutionary spirit of the times every time he was with the kooky petulia . aside from the brilliant performances , this surreal-styled film , with its successful flashbacks but not so successful flash-forwards , was rather a disorientated and emotionally cold film . it was impossible to warm up to these elusive and neurotic characters , each trapped by fate or indecision . by the film's end , the same problems that existed in the beginning were still present . george c . scott is still chasing something that he is not sure of . they all have quirky personalities , but they are all straight and it seems odd that a film so grounded in the '60s actually missed having truly representative characters of that age . i thought the film was too cutely done and lacked depth .
rating:0 high fidelity ( director : stephen frears ; screenwriters : d . v . this wormy role is one that he has been seemingly typecast for in most of his films to date . his narcissistic performance totally grossed-me out , even though i liked a few things about this feel-good , quirky movie , but whose plot could have been better explored if it was discovered what the plot was and whose story would have been given more credence if it had a sharper script , a better sense of pacing , and less screen time for the annoying cusack character . cusack spent nearly ninety percent of the film's time looking right at the camera and explaining to the audience what he was thinking and doing , as if the story was made for an einstein-type and needed to be decifered to the under-thirty something audience targeted to see this film . rob is griping to the camera about his failures in romance , and in imitation of the david letterman's tv show shtick of making lists to elicit laughs from the audience , rob is prone to making top 5 lists , having recently completed his " top 5 all-time breakups " , going through those he most clearly recalls , giving the audience a running narration on each of those romances . by gosh , what is this fine comedic actress doing in this film , and to the bargain , taking such a miniscule part ! laura ( iben hjejle-a danish actress making her american debut ) is the best thing about this film . her lips are of a succulent ruby red color , and when she pouts or a small smile comes over her , there is a very sensuous crease that comes over her mouth and chin area-- plus she has a nice laugh and cries in a dignified manner when she has to . what the film does well , is capture the nostalgia and musty atmosphere of a place where music geeks hang-out , memorizing tunes and reciting them back-and-forth to each other , as if they were idiot savants who overdosed on sugar . he's a van morrison clone without the singer's voice or forebearance or manners . the clerks' attitude toward the customers was brusque , but the exchanges that resulted were very dear . in keeping with the spirit of the film , i made a top 5 list of things i liked about the film and a more involved top 5 list of things that i didn't like about the film . first what i liked : 1 . the soundtrack kicked ass . 2 . the two musical geek clerks were funnier than batman and robin in hell . i didn't have to pronounce iben hjejle's name to know what i liked about her . 4 . lisa bonet made up for her inconsequential part and gratuitous sex scene by adding a beautiful song to the film and a warm presence to a story that wasn't that hot to begin with . i can count on my left hand how many films were made about geek music-store clerks who work in musical stores that are not in a mall . what i didn't like : 1 . john cusack is either a putz or someone who is acting like a putz , but in either case , i can't handle watching a needlessly long film ( over two hours ) such as this one , with someone as self-absorbed as he is , without getting a headache . 2 . the story seemed to be a never-ending one , where there were at least three times that i thought the movie had wound down and was about to conclude . instead , the movie got a second wind and added more banal storyline to keep it going . it seemed to be poorly edited and written with a few different endings in mind and failed to make its rewrites seamless . the result is a very shoddy film , even if it is adapted from a popular cult comic novel of the same name written by nick hornsby . the film has not been improved by changing the setting from london to chicago , and as far as i'm concerned , it could have been set in mars or venus , with the same results gleaned . the love angle was predictable and wimpy . but this was formula sitcom stuff all the way , as all three music geeks got some reward for their long-suffering for the art of nostalgia and trivia and useless knowledge . 4 . for a movie that is about growing up , maturing , and handling relationships , somehow the characters didn't particularly make me interested in how any of their relationships were resolved . i felt used by this film . and i had to listen to him kvetch for the entire film and i'm not even a psychoanalyst who gets paid to hear such dribble but a long-suffering movie critic who was bored to death by this very forgettable pop culture movie and couldn't wait for the session ( uh ! movie ) to end .
rating:2 a strangely intriguing , darkly made psychological allegory based on the late walker hamilton's only novel . it is the directorial debut film of jeremy thomas , the producer of bertolucci , roeg , and cronenberg films , and the husband of the screenwriter eski thomas . the film works its way to a suspenseful but tacky and implausible revenge conclusion , as all its energy seems to have been spent on its fairy tale setup and the relationship between the two kindred spirits . but , nevertheless , this film , if you allowed it to be seen as a proficiently lyrical work , one that is heartfelt and never false , then you can feel the sincerity of it and you can see in the grand shots of bobby's escape to the wilderness , away from civilization , as he earnestly narrates his tale of woe offscreen , how poetical the film is and how it is a modern fairy tale for adults and fans of the cinema that still believe that movies can make them see things again as they did when they were children .
rating:2 mamet's second effort as a director , after his diabolically successful house of games , is a totally different styled film . it's a mafia black comedy , with undertones of being film noir . the director's witty dialogue and penchant for interesting plot lines are there , but this film is not as sharp-edged as his other work . their gambling venture turns into the weakest part of the film because it is not believable . this is the entertainment highlight of the weekend for them . it also sparks jerry to tell gino not to get too carried away that the girls like them so much , " they always like you when you're someone else . " that's pure mamet dialogue . this scene is brilliantly done , a true pleasure to watch as the men through long drawn-out silences converse without saying much that gives them away . the gestures and the timing of the two is masterful , as the two embrace after much vague conversational banter and recognize each other as equals . there were scenes that lacked weight and seemed phony , but these three main characters gave this film a brilliance in character study : ameche by his brilliantly restrained performance , mantegna by his energetic and funny one , and prosky by his perfectly menacing and touching one . it lifted the film into a rich mixture of farce , gang violence , and tenderness . it's a film that comes with a perfect shoeshine and a perfect smile underneath its ludicrous and cynical premise .
rating:2 this might be the best junkie film ever made . the new zealander , alison maclean ( crush ) , directed denis johnson's book of short dramatic stories with a sharp eye for comedy , where the addiction story plays second fiddle to the overall psychological problems of the addict . billy crudup is simply ingenious in this sterling role as the poetic voice of the author , making the internal musings of denis johnson's disjointed surreal stories come to life , not quite like in the book , but in its own cinematic way . that this impossible book was adapted to the screen , is a minor miracle itself , though it is certainly not a fault-free film , as it petered out toward the end from sluggishness . but if viewed as a story that doesn't have to make too much sense , because a junky' life doesn't make too much sense anyway , then the film can be savored for its fair quota of highs . the film is divided into chapter headings , which are flashed onscreen , as fh rants on like the stoned out freak he is . there might be some unintentional moral to the story at this point , as they both take the heroin but wayne keels over dead from it . " jesus' son , " a title snatched from a lou reed song , has many glorious moments of dry humor , pungency , sadness and unpredictability ; it exhibits the rare quality all special films have , it requires some effort to see what the film is about , and though it is a likable film , it does not aim to please its audience . it is a film that zig-zags all over the map , with its target being pop culture in america and how one survivor of the drug culture , who is so disarming and real , will have his maddening story breathe life into his messed up junkie veins and give vent to dreams he has that are as relevant as any genuine religious experience .
rating:3 an outstanding melodrama . it's a film noir that is influenced by freudian psychology , and was shot in 18 days by otto preminger . the result was that this was arguably her best film performance and otto , a known bully to actors , came up with an intelligent and exciting thriller . the film scores big because of the great nuanced performances from the stars robert mitchum and simmons , the sharp black and white photography contrasting the wealthy estate to mitchum's humble stature and rosy dreams , that the tale of obsessive love was credibly presented , and the typical noir tale of the protagonists getting hooked on sex and money gave the film the dark energy it thrived on .
rating:0 it's a post-war baroque melodrama , creaky as wooden steps in an old mildewed house might be . it's from the german ? migr ? director , john brahm , who gives this genre a decidedly european flavor . " the locket " has something to say about a person with a severe personality disorder needing the proper psychological therapy . it was too wooden a presentation to generate anything but a few sparks . but the way of telling the story by flashbacks within flashbacks , from the view of the male lovers who were deceived by the pert heroine , nancy blair ( laraine day ) , is visually unconventional , and the story itself , is cleverly diverting . this was one role that was not suited for his temperament . it's one of the few performances i thought he was awful in . this action disappoints nancy . as an added bit of melodramatics , blair cracked up over this and was institutionalized , and only recently was released . it's a somber story , with a lot of heavy-handed things going on . the plot devices were too leaden to be fully credible , but the complexities of the heroine's character were well presented . the analyst's comments about her stealing to get even with mrs . willis , seemed to be a reasonable explanation , if taken on face value . but that doesn't answer her ability to murder or her depraved indifference to men while pretending to like them . the locket only had some glitter but not enough substance to make its aims lucidly felt . though , as muddled as it was , it still kept me alert , wanting to know what gives . the problem is , that i never found out what gives .
rating:1 the film's major fault is that it is too stagy a production . he is weird , slow-witted and obnoxious , but he does not have the same kind of depraved sexual relationship with parker as josh does . she is cute but not too swift , and is as straight as an arrow . i found tori's performance to be lacking in spunk , especially when compared to the fine ensemble cast she is surrounded by . how much you like this film depends on your idea of comedy and how much tolerance you have for " sick humor . " if this kind of parody over the tragedy that rocked the country , upsets you , and you think it is in bad taste , then you shouldn't see this film . if your reaction is like mine , then you will find that when this picture is on the mark , which is quite often , you will laugh aloud , and when it misses the mark , you might even wince . the real flaw in the film is when it starts to take its comedy seriously and thinks it has to explain itself and come up with an academic explanation for the parker character's obsession . it would have been better to have just ridden the comedy out and have been criticized by those who didn't like where the comedy was going . it seemed unnecessary to have changed the mood of the film and all of sudden offered some psychological explanations for jacki-o' behavior . the staple in the film was parker posey , the princess of the indie film . she , simply , steals the film .
rating:0 the trouble with carlyle's part ( not his performance ) was that it had no punch to it , he couldn't make it an interesting role . the stories he told about the english bringing fleas and the damp to ireland , didn't evoke the comedy or sympathy for him that it should have . the whole point of the film will be a long and trying study in misery and poverty , as the family will undergo a series of hardships , including the loss of three young children . the film never gets untracked from its maudlin attitude . it suffers from the old problem of trying to portray misery without having a film that can escape from being miserable itself . the other problem is that the misery seemed unreal , everything about it seemed so uninvolving and pristine . the film was flat . it was hard to care about what was happening to them , except the obvious reaction one gets when seeing a poor household . their endless plight seemed no different from the beginning of the film to the end . it was the filmmakers job , the director alan parker , along with the screenwriter , laura jones , to make me want to care , but instead , they made me feel too distant to honestly feel anything . and if misery per se were an interesting topic , this adaptation of frank mccourt's book might be too . to make matters even worse , this is an excrutiatingly long film , over two-and-a-half-hour running time , and it seemed to go on forever . this almost solemn film portrayal , with an irish brogue voiceover throughout its entirety , explaining every little piece of misery as if were a work of sublime art , did not work for me . the film has a bored look about it , indicating nothing much is going to happen except for a string of gross events and that frank , as a survivor , will somehow come through all this misery . it almost seems to be a shame not to connect with the family's plight , but as well-intentioned as this film was and as good as the pulitzer prize winning autobiography was supposed to be ( i didn't read it ) , it was , nevertheless , made into a conventional film with nothing in it to really rave about . most life stories do not make for good dramatics in films anyway , they seem better suited for the printed page . this one is no exception .
rating:1 he has taught film at columbia university and nyu , and has said that he made this film because he can't remember as a youth watching films that were made in chile . the film was written spontaneously while at the workshop to fit the emotions of the teenage actors recruited . it's a familiar theme about teenage alienation , as the story suffers at times from being strained . also , there are raw emotional scenes that are difficult to watch when they are extended for too long . but what prevents this one from just being a clich ? teenager film , is that they are presented as genuine teens even if they are not that appealing and the story might not be compelling to everyone--especially those who watch such loud kids in public places and are turned off by them ( i guess that would include me in that category ) . the film is political in nature and it should be best understood by the teens now living in chile who are familiar with the social climate in their home turf . the teens grapple with their frustrations and loneliness , and mature somewhat by the film's end . this seemed to be what the audience was rooting for to happen , as they were obnoxious but not bad sorts .
rating:1 there should also be some nostalgia left over for the days of bungalow colonies as family vacation spots , for those who might have experienced that sort of vacation when growing up or raising a family . the moral question the film raises about adultery can only be resolved accordingly by the parties affected , and so what happens in the film's mild rendering to the problem seems credible at first glance , as it is put forth in a way that worked out for the film's sake but might not have seemed correct for many a viewer , or at least , it was not important enough to be resolved by the film , even if that clash was supposedly the whole point of the film . the acting was convincing , the story had a nice feel to it , and it followed along with the historical mood the country was going through at that time . what the film lacked , was resolution . i thought that the fleeting affair she had with the long-haired sculptured adonis figure , certainly satisfied her sexual needs but the bigger moral question of adultery was never even attempted to be answered with any kind of satisfactory response , which left me believing that the liaison was the thing here , just like in those romantic pulp fiction books that are an easy read , with nothing more to tax your mind .
rating:2 it's become a cult-status film , that has staying power as a rather lyrical horror classic . this last incident is the violent note on how the film abruptly ends . the film plays as an allegory , and has a certain strength in its story telling . by the film's end , there's not much difference between the two families as the fight for survival brings everyone down to the level of a beast . i guess that's the point of the film .
rating:1 a superficial but entertaining roller-coaster-ride of nonstop action featuring clich ? characters and contrived dangerous situations , mainly conceived to show off the special effects . the story is so slight that there is no danger of it interfering with the action scenes . it's a hollywood blockbuster for those in need of escaping reality for two hours and should prove to be enjoyable for those who are willing to go with the flow of the action and suspend their critical judgment . the reward will be a visual treat of well-executed stunts and a film that had the glossy look of a national geographic photography shoot . movie viewers could go snowblind just watching a series of mountain catastrophes befall the adventurous climbers , as the film throws out almost any possible danger there is to be found on a mountain and the mountain climbers try to overcome these impossible obstacles and , there is , needlessly to say , a race-against-time sequence , with a last second rescue in the works . the opening eight-minute scene , derivative as it is , is brilliantly done and captures whatever underlying tension the film was to later on build up to . she is still upset with what peter did and could hardly face him , much less talk to him about it . the commercial motive for the climb and the callous way he will soon treat his fellow climbers , makes him the film's designated one-dimensional villain , and adds some more spice to a film that is overspiced already with clich ? s . the rescuers will try to blast the victims out of the cavern , but must be very careful when climbing because with just one spill of the explosive liquid there is the certainty of a tremendous explosion . there will be many tremendous explosions that rock the himalayas , and -- if mountains repeatedly exploding and climbers falling down mountain peaks in colorful ways is your idea of enjoyment , then this is the film for you . the action keeps coming , the clich ? s get resolved somehow , and even though the action sequences couldn't possibly be real , the great photography and beautiful vistas made the locations seem out of this world . the filmmaker used the southern alps in new zealand as his setting , and you could have fooled me , because it sure looked like the himalayas . it also looked like it could be a long commercial for beautiful yuppie adventurers who are shooting an ad for club med , or a national geographic tv special , or even one of those action thrillers that doesn't believe it needs good dialogue to tell its heroic fantasy story .
rating:2 it is always fascinating when a great foreign director takes a look at his own country in a way that outsiders can't really see it . he seems to have their best interest at heart and he cures them of their ills , and they know this , but the ones in charge don't seem to care and treat him as if he were a quack . i have not read the book to confirm this but this is what the director said in an interview that was reported by a film 'zine . what struck me as rather odd for the moment , until i thought further about it , was the film's opening , as the first words spoken are english that come from american bomber pilots flying over okayama , an island village next to the doctor's hometown of hibi , with a pow camp and a factory . this seems to indicate the influence america and its film industry has had on this quintessential japanese director and the need he has to show that the world is not necessarily a homogenous place , that all nations are influenced by each other . it is a rather odd philosophical opinion for one to have , especially for one who was himself getting bombed during the war ( imamura was a teen at the time of the war ) . no one in this film will get exactly what they want . this is a chaotic story that covers more topics than you could shake a stick at . this imamura film is not by any means his definitive one , but it shows enough of his lifetime concerns to be an interesting one for him to make his swan song in . what it suffers from is that the combination of comedy and serious drama have too many awkward and slow moments , that show many reactions to what the director visibly feels and makes them look as if they were predictably put into the cluttered story and don't have a breath of their own . to see how great a director he is , is to contrast those tepid scenes with some of the scenes that have his magical hand in it and see how simple and moving they were . there is no moral judgment that this is an american bomb , as it seems the philosophy here is , that when you live by the sword you must expect to die that way . the better choice for his country would have been one of practising a more loving nature , something that seems obvious , but what is also obvious is that the world has not learned that simple lesson and continues to rely on military might to fight its battles . in one conversation between akagi and sonoko , the beauty of their characters is magnified , as the deadly bacteria is viewed under the microscope and sonoko on seeing it , exclaims how beautiful it is : sonoko : " are there men and women bacteria ? " akagi : " neither male nor female , just perpetual reproductive motion . " " that doesn't exist in nature . more fun . " this film might not be a masterpiece ( which i don't think it is ) but it is clearly a film by a great man , a man who sees the contradictions in life in an amusing and contentiously cynical way , someone who can put the virtuous doctor in the same boat with the whore , and not be bothered by any moral judgments about who the better person is , because to him they are both beautiful . a strange farcical comedy results , that is often brilliant and at other times too messy to follow in all the cloudy trails it leads to .
rating:1 blood , guts , bullets & octane ( director/writer : joe carnahan ; cinematography : john a . jimenez ; cast : joe carnahan ( sid french ) , dan leis ( bob melba ) , ken rudulph ( f . b . i . another tarantino look alike indie , filmed in thirteen days for $7 , 300 , and it sure gets its money's worth for the effort . the filmmaker has come up with a crime-thriller spoof done at a hyper-frenetic pace that is as good if not better than most hollywood high-budget action films of this type . but it went on for too long and the fun subsided and soon became grating just like a bad commercial . but the quick pace of the film kept things moving briskly and their use of quirky titled chapters to each little skit , kept the level of juvenile humor this film was imbued with at a bearable level . one such chapter was titled " coldblooded hotheads , " just to give you an idea at what the film was driving at . it's a vintage pontiac le mans burgundy convertible that will soon be dropped off to them and they will be paid $250 , 000 if they allow it to sit on the lot for two days without trying to sell it or even touch it . a number of preposterous twists come about , as the film winds its way to its final payoff , where we see suitcases filled with money being exchanged , cocaine lined up in the trunk in plastic baggies , all sorts of high-powered guns exhibited , and mysterious packets of blood . the immoral main characters end up talking about what is right and wrong with themselves and the world they live in , which adds a nice touch of absurdity to the already absurd story . the film had energy , a ready made metaphor in the pontiac and the used-car lot , a semi-plausible plot , some promise in the filmmaker's ability to tell a story , some choppy dialogue that could be amusing at times , and enough nerve from the actors who at times improvised and got by with it , as it looked better than a film school film , which is what it most reminded me of . it was not innovative enough to be a superior work , it needlessly displayed too much homage to other contemporary indies to make this film seem special . yet it was engaging and at times very funny .
rating:1 this film has a different look to it , as its color tones are strikingly in browns and soft yellows . they added a touch of black humor . ripstein also has a dizzying amount of extra shots of things that don't play exactly into the story but add some arty points he's trying to make about the outside influences facing the alienated julia . i wasn't enlightened by these unnecessary scenes , in fact i thought they were pretentious . almost the entire film is a boring rant by julia , where a fine actress like arcelia ramirez just over acted and failed to bring the audience over to her side . her classical story didn't play like great drama , but felt more like soap opera or a tragic headline newspaper story one reads these days of a mother snapping and killing her children for no logical reason . all the drama evaporated from this presentation , as the film's reward seemed to be a visual feast of looking at the interior of an apartment situated in an ugly apartment building's courtyard . yet this film shouldn't be totally ignored , as the auteur director took chances with this story and was technically innovative as he gave the film a different look to it . that alone should earn him applause for the effort made . at least , his film wasn't stale as most commercial ventures are today . the overriding fault for this art-house film was that it is not poetic in a story that must be poetic to be felt as drama and not soap opera . it unfortunately comes off as too distant ( it's lost in the mundane world for the answers to julia's problems ) for the viewer to empathize with julia's internal misery . it also suffers from comparison to other medea presentations--so many great versions of it were put on as plays , plus the film versions by pasolini and von trier were far superior .
rating:1 a sci-fi film , originally started as a student project , noted only for its great special effects , as created by dennis muren . muren now does the special effects for george lucas on his star war films and won an oscar for his work . this film is a good example of his first effort doing special effects in a feature film . the problem with this film -- that came 30 years before blair witch project and has its same scary themes played out in the woods by students -- is its amateur acting , shoddy production values , horrible script , and ridiculous story . the acting is so flat and awkward , that the film never seemed professional , even though it was reworked for theatrical release . it could be appreciated by some horror film buffs despite all its shortcomings and genre clich ? s for its crudeness . there are just some people who love bad films . the film is one long flashback of dave's recollections , as he seems to be also recollecting things he wasn't even involved with . don't ask me how he can do that ! jim , in between bites on his picnic chicken , says this is pretty heavy stuff . hey , jim ! the remainder of the film is a testimony to the special effects created on such a limited budget , but the story can only be constued as ridiculous , as the four young students who must have taken stupid pills to still be hanging around in the woods , continue on with their adventure . asmodeus will show his true face to jim and make him an offer for the book , offering to conjure up anything in the world he wants for it , which sounds like a fair trade , if you ask me .
rating:2 the payoff in the film comes in a slick surprise ending , as now has become the custom of the director and is what the audience expects . night has honed his skills from his previous films by showing an improvement in technique and filmmaking style , while continuing his penchant for making films with box-office pop . though there is a certain disdainful emptiness in this film , as there was in his others , but this film sustains itself with the keen performances by the understated one bruce willis gives and the punctiliously perverse one samuel l . jackson gives , as the film is able to amble along at its leisurely pace , building on character development and the unique relationship the two stars develop , until the mystery story takes hold in the last twenty minutes and puts the exclamation point on the far-fetched tale it was weaving . this subdued action film is unlike other action-hero films , as the action is not the thing here . what counts the most , is what secret the film is covering up and why . it is especially delightful for those who like puzzlers and think they can gather enough clues to take a stab at guessing the outcome . even though night has matured as a director , this surprise ending is not as engaging as the one he came up with in the blockbuster the sixth sense , which caught audiences completely off-guard . but this film is a more mature work and has fuller characterizations . so the former has arguably a better ending , but this one is a better realized overall film . the basic plot is simple . as his face changes expressions , we can sense something tragic is about to happen . elijah believes that david may be the 'unbreakable' person he is looking for , someone to give hope for this mediocre age we live in , as he believes the super-hero myth is as true as if it was history -- which is asking a lot for an adult audience to swallow , but . . . that's hollywood ! and if he has a weakness , it might be water , as even superman had a weakness from kryptonite . his reasoning supposes -- " if there is someone like me in the world , shouldn't there be someone at the other end of the spectrum ? " the major stumbling block , to this otherwise involving film , is the let down in the third act . the action in it seemed obligatory and not really germane to the story , as an anonymous psycho serial killer is introduced to prove that david has the super-powers of the comic book hero . this encounter , of him stopping the violent psychopath killer never worked right , as it seemed flat and arbitrary , spoiling but not ruining the overall achievement of the film . what this unconventional mainstream film did right for itself , was to provide a modern type of super-hero for an audience that thrives on escapist films that can fill them with some hope that there's a savior out there in the fight between good and evil ( something hollywood films could always be counted on to provide the public with ) . it is a film that is confident enough of its ability to tell its story that it doesn't have to rely on special effects . and , perhaps , as an homage to hitchcock or maybe it's a case of egomania , night once again appears in his own film .
rating:1 it is filmed with calm detachment , in black-and- white , giving the film a taut look , as the action is sharp and ruthless , by men who are all business . it is interesting to see how melville could make a low level hood like gus , into a seemingly ethical person , that is , within the standards of the criminal mind , and be deemed as an almost sympathetic and , at the same time , pathetic figure , whose crime spree , though unforgiveable , will nevertheless , offer us something about him that is redeeming , that even the wily inspector bleu recognizes . this is not great noir , because the acting seemed jarred , but it has a certain tension in it that sustains its somber mood .
rating:0 his life is a dreary , loveless mess . this film is noted for showing the slum side to beautiful oslo , where we see crime , ugly buildings , the subway , and problems outsiders do not associate with this peaceful and scenic country . the film spends most of the first half of the movie showing him to be a screw off , everything he touches he fouls up , a complete loser-- there is a long tradition of hollywood comedians who have exploited that avenue of comedy . his comic effect , is a deadpan expression , that absorbs all criticism that comes his way . what is funny , is the way he looks at us , as he looks at the camera , showing us his hurt feelings and pathetic nature , emphasizing to us that he is a natural screw up . but the picture has darker ulterior motives than that , it will chuck out all the work it did setting up the film as a fluff piece of comedy and go for the criminal aspects to the story , a decision that has to change how we approach seeing this film , we can no longer be content to relax , laughing at this inept mailman , we have to now see how he handles himself under fire , while the director , also , tries to bring romance into the story . as far as i am concerned , the film loses track of what it is capable of doing at this point of the story , and it becomes a different film , where one contrived situation after another occurs to keep the story suspenseful , with the buffoon-like georg menacing roy . roy is now the subject of a film that doesn't know if it wants to be viewed as a suspense or romance yarn , or just as a plain comedy . roy still acts with the same deadpan expression , as a result , everything becomes muddled and ridiculous . the laugh situations seem forced , the romance absurd , and the suspense unreal . at best , i found this film to be a modest effort at comedy , that results in a modest film , barely being less than annoying , but redeemed by showing me the darker side of oslo , a side that i have not seen before on screen . so i think that this first time director , who is guilty of trying to come up with too many different twists to the story , and by relying on a hero to carry the film who is not very likable , and a story line that is very thin , has defeated the comic efforts that he was successful with during the first part of the film , but by the end of the film , wears down to a barely passable effort at comedy .
rating:2 my sex life ( or how to get into an argument ) [comment je me suis dispute . . . some might find this appealing film about parisian twenty-somethings , who refuse to grow up , to be quite amusing . these troubled student-intellectual types love to talk and are charmingly neurotic , in a film that unjustifiably goes on for three hours but does so in a surprisingly breezy fashion . i would have more carefully edited this film , as there were too many scenes that were nice but not impactful enough to keep . what the film does just right , that caught my interest from a psychological point of view : is penetrate the students' loneliness , the mind-games they play , their ideas about sex and love , their foolish need to lie , and the tribal nature of their relationships . these sort of devilish characters could be very attractive to the opposite sex , especially if they are handsome like he is and equipped with a facade of sensitivity and innate intelligence . you see , he thinks he loves another girl even more , sylvia ( denicourt ) , whose performance steals the film because of her unwitting sexual charm being displayed in such a capricious manner . nathan does not know that he knew sylvia before , which should tell you something about their close friendship . this really fine ensemble cast takes this meandering , real-life type of a story and makes it into an absorbing drama , carefully scrutinizing their intricate and confusing lives . val ? rie is very demanding , and suffers from being a bit metally unbalanced . jeanne balibar gives an eye-catching performance , one that adds just the right degree of spice to the meal being cooked . there are a few diverting subplots that are deftly handled by the director , as paul is snubbed by his pretentious ex-friend rabier ( vuillermoz ) , who becomes to his chagrin , head of the epistemology department at the university . what the film fails to do , after one may grow weary of all the charm it exudes , is provide any rationalizations or explanations for the split-ups and ongoing relationships . there are no shared intimacies , or greater emotional or intellectual depths explored . but the film is still a rather compelling and superbly acted-out black comedy , that has its glorious moments , but cannot go past its own facile limits it set-for- itself .
rating:3 his rambling story is a near-masterpiece of vision and great perception of what was taking place , as it let go of plot development and storyline , and instead captured the moods , atmosphere , and insights making up the changing landscape in america's unprecedented time of political unrest and social change , as the mostly white middle-class student joined with the black militants demanding that the system change . the explosions take place in slow-motion and pink floyd's " careful with that axe , eugene " plays as the products of commercialization go floating by . antonioni wanted to make a film that visually shows that it is a change of attitude inside your head that changes the system and not violence . that if you can't change yourself and are still caught in the consumerism trap , you can't change the way society is driven , you will only change the surface of things . reality is inside your head . it is not by killing off your enemies that you accomplish your aims , but by getting your act together so that you are not part of the problem . it is up to you to make the world a better place to live . she promptly takes off , as antonioni is sending a message that if you think you can escape from the world and your responsibilities by retreating from it , you are mistaken , you only make matters worst . the film originally garnered bad reviews in general and ended up being a commercial failure , subjecting the director to some unfairly harsh criticism . but it was probably the most perceptive film made about that turbulent time , and it is not outdated like most of the critically praised films of that particular genre are when viewed today .
rating:1 a zippy youth oriented christmas movie ( though there is no bing singing white christmas in this one ) marketed for the druggie generation of post-teens and those in their late 20s , that is perhaps a cut above the rest of the mindless offerings flooding the market to capture filmland's largest share of ticket buyers , as it tells its somewhat derivative black comic tale , ( pulp fiction type dialogue and style ) , fuelled by the originality of its accelerated pace , using the cool life-style in lala land as its backdrop , and telling about its main characters who either work in a supermarket or are involved small time in using or pushing pills . in this frenetically paced film , the innovative young director , doug liman , following his indie debut feature , swingers , shows that he has a feel for these young people and their problematic world , as he grapples with their realities , giving us a good look at how they view themselves , their job and their customers . the most amusing bit , is that we see her pushing aspirins and sinus pills as substitutes for the hallucinogenic ectasy pill , at a party , where those who are there , are so high already , they don't know the difference from one pill to the other . i though fichtner was the funniest and most malevolent one in the film . i don't think the film had much to say about much of anything , including the use of drugs , but it hit hard at being an hilarious film , with its fast-paced mood swings , its sharp editing cuts and frequent light changes , allowing its story to be easy to watch , and imbuing the characters with a certain attitude about them , that made their performances seem eclectic . i especially liked sarah polley , when she wasn't on the screen the film seemed to lack purpose . in any case , go has watch ability because of its raw energy , and the way it was able to get inside a pill poppers head and to convey on screen how hallucinatory his world looks when he is high . yet the film for all its innovative features , still could not escape , from being on the edge of sitcom and not on the edge of innovative filmmaking . the film's appeal is still mostly with the younger generation . they are the ones who are mostly likely to be amused at how the main characters in the story comport themselves , while the older generations might not be as amused , and feel put off by the lack of any character depth or real wit in the story . and the benign ending , not only didn't make sense , but seemed artificial and embarrassing to watch . it was as if this film after using all its energy in rebellion , now wants to conform and give the adults a happy ending .
rating:0 lies become the theme of the film , as it is examined how harmless or necessary they are for people , especially since most people live hum-drum lives and could use a little imagination to liven things up . people also lie because they feel hurt about things and think that by lying they can make themselves feel better . the spanish director , bigas luna ( jamon , jamon/golden balls/the tit and the moon ) , known to make very unconventional and sexually implicit films , has apparently toned down his act here , shooting for satire as his only proverbial fish in the barrel to shoot at . not only did i find this film a bore , the acting uninspiring , and the motif unconvincing , but what annoyed me most , was that there was scene after scene of horty telling his inane story of his dying love for marie , to an audience that pays to hear this so they can have a good cry over it . it seemed to be pushing in the audience face what the director was supposedly satirizing . the film is a parody of a need people have to hear great stories , whether they are true or not , which might be a good idea on which to anchor a film , but this one had no heart-beat to it . the melodramatic soapy romantic story , just never sailed gracefully across the ocean . the film was never able to be poetic or articulate about the point it was trying to make , instead it just settled for looking good , but couldn't rejuvenate through this feeble storytelling ploy , the art of good storytelling . there was just no passion to be found in all these handsome stars ; the idea of the film , that one can't live without imagination in one's life , was a worthy idea that never fully materialized . it has the look of one of those arty-farty films , the ones that only play in art houses and pretend to be something more arty than what they are .
rating:0 a far-fetched thriller that bogs done in an incredible situation by the film's last 20 minutes . there's something dry about her performance . there's also the lack of chemistry in the relationship she has with the spader character . this was not a very satisfying thriller : it lacked conviction , memorable performances , and intelligent dialogue . an example of the film's inane dialogue can best be heard in a typical conversation between the two protagonists . spader : you're a psychopath . amick : even psychopaths can still love somebody . this kind of talk might be especially appealing to the psychopaths in the audience . there weren't many layers to peel away from this story before discovering how manipulative it was , how it was without a strong actor's presence , and how it failed to make a strong psychological imprint ; the characters were made into objects of a contrived tale causing the film to lag .
rating:0 this low-budget , inane , cheesy , message sci-fier was of such poor quality that it was laughable and entertaining in a way goofy films sometimes can be . the clunky message of the film ( the way the film presents it is clunky ) , is that all the world's nations should be working for peace and not getting into the nuclear arms race . but the invaders act to offer proof . delivering such a warning during a hockey game took my mind off the puck , but is that the proper world stage to deliver such a message ! this is a classic in bad sci-fi b-movies . highly recommended for those who understand that a film doesn't have to be good to be enjoyable . i liked it . . . mainly for its banal dialogue delivered in robotic tones !
rating:0 soul survivors , written and directed by steve carpenter , the writer of blue streak and the upcoming ocean's eleven remake , is a by-the-numbers horror movie whose only real scare comes from the sudden blast of a starter's pistol at a swim meet . even the ending explanation leaves plenty of plot holes to ponder . well , it would if the movie weren't so instantly forgettable . along the way people say trite little things to encourage the survivors . about the only reason to see soul survivors is if you are desperate for a guilty pleasure . carpenter tosses in a few erotic scenes , but ones that are in no danger of threatening his film's pg-13 rating . don't worry . they stay fully clothed at all times . this would be good advice for those who decide to see this movie . it is rated pg-13 for " terror/violence , sexuality and some substance abuse , " and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up . just send me a letter with the word " subscribe " in the subject line .
rating:2 this is the movie not the perfume . a slow moving , stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcock's vertigo . it is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader , and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader . the surprises to come weren't really all that surprising , as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson , the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ? ve bujold , and the competent acting of john lithgow . it plays too much like a rehash of the master's work , to break any new ground , yet it is still thrilling in its own way .
rating:2 an atmospheric , thrilling whodunit , that is full of surprises , is fast-paced , and is well-acted . but the case puzzles him as all the clues so easily point to brent , it's as if the ex-con has been framed .
rating:1 considering the budget constraints the film was operating under , this film nevertheless proves to be an entertaining one and features a well-crafted script by jerome bixby ; it is one that is devoid for the most part ( except for the character played by kim spalding ) of stock characterizations . it sets an eerie atmosphere by its shadowy photography and in the claustrophobic setting of the spaceship , and even if the monster in a rubber-suit was not as scary as laughable--that only proves how much fun the film could be . i happened to like it better than i did alien , even though the later is technically far superior .
rating:2 this powerhouse of a film is geared to get under your skin and is not , as most hollywood films are , made to amuse you and cater to your idea of what a romantic film is supposed to be . labute's debut film is hard to describe , though the plot is simple enough , but this is not a film that depends on plot for it to be understood . that what comes out of these conversations , to say the least , is disdainful , but that is not the point labute is trying to make , nor does he use these talks solely for shock value . what is taking place is more real than that , and much more frightening . playwright labute uses words that are meant to be spiteful and piercing to one's fragile ego . the scene with the black intern is bound to rub people the wrong way , as it takes us into the strident relationships these business warriors have , and adds the racial issue as another dimension to its political incorrectness stance . but the point of the story is , that their life is absurd , so why not get what you want , no matter what you have to do to get it ) . at least , we have the feeling that aaron understands this . the movie is not driven by plot , so what unfolds is somewhat unconventional for movie lore ( though not for the world of plays , from where the director draws his strength ( ala mamet ) , which has a much richer history of misogynistic characters being the ones you love to hate ) . what is here unpleasant and shameful and immoral , is played out to the hilt with all the traumas one could expect . i must respectfully say , this film has balls . no matter how politically incorrect and unbelievable the story might be , it still attracts our attention and makes us react to it on a visceral level . i think that is because we have all questioned our relationships at one time or another and felt a certain vulnerability , and wonder about how that other person now feels , the one who did harm to us , how is he or she getting on . this film does that to us ; it provokes us to look at things that are unpleasant in our lives . we realize that aaron wins because he is a charmer , but those not taken in by sharing his deceits would not be taken in by his charm . but we are not really comfortable with aaron's aggressiveness , and out first reaction , is to recoil from him in horror when seeing him so depicted on screen . but i wonder how many aaron-types we have met in real-life and didn't recoil from . and his lies , are the kind that those without a true sense of themselves tell ; while , the matts' of this world are the humorless types you might have had a morning coffee with and felt you were with someone you didn't quite like but didn't know why , as they seemed nice enough in the office ambiance , but you know instinctively that you can't trust them , that they will harm you if they can , that they just can't help being the worms they are . stacy is the only one in the film that we are supposed to feel for . the three stars are all excellent in convincing us of who they are in the film . stacy's role might seem to be the most difficult one to pull off , because of her portrayal of deafness and vulnerability , and being " the female " in the film . this is not a flawless picture , but it is one that penetrates the masculine soul of the competitive capitalistic system that feeds on aggressiveness and getting results at the cost of coming to grips with one's more tender feminine side . it is able to captivate us , because its words have power .
rating:1 he assumes this will happen once he displays the bomb at the science fair and he also thinks , what could they do to me if i'm caught , i'm just a kid ! at the fair , the film breaksdown into a madcap thriller . unfortunately , only a few of marshall brickman's funny pearls get into the script . the one line i liked the best , is when lithgow is warning the kid about how tough the government agents could be when they grill you : " they'll lock you in a room and then they'll throw away the room . " the tense scene back in the science lab consists of all the usual melodramatics seen in most typical action films , but what makes this film a little bit different , is that there have actually been seven fatalities at nuclear plants across america , even though this information is not widely known by the public . i use as my source of reference , for this information , dr . michio kaku , professor of theoretical physics , at ccny . so even if the film sunk rapidly into the pits of a pointless preachy exercise about nuclear dangers , there still was something absorbing about these nuclear scientists seen doing their job . and it was , at least , not one of those awful summer teenager movies . in fact , the acting was quite good in spots , especially , by christopher collet ; he convinced me he was a smart kid , while john lithgow convinced me that he was a scientist with a warm heart .
rating:1 a complex contemporary horror flick based on a novel by whitley strieber , that is slow in developing and when it becomes evident what's happening there's more interest intellectually in what is uncovered than thrills . there's much self-indulgent ecology to chew on , in this slickly filmed surrealistic presentation . but i found the film to be on the dull side ( except for the camera work ) . outstanding british cinematographer gerry fisher does the honors of making this a very stylish looking film , which gives the impression that something deeper than what appears to be happening is taking place . all the camera shots are presented in this manner , showing how the wolves can pick up man's scent much quicker than he can theirs and their heat-seeking vision can detect their quarry's body temperature . they cannot be vanquished ; so i guess the message is , that we better learn how to live with the werewolf , they will always be with us . hey , i'm willing to give it shot . . . as i think finney is , also .
rating:2 it is adapted from a semi-autobiographical book written as a teenager in the '50s , for a national literary contest , by john kennedy toole . when this slow-moving film works , and it often does , it is artistically and subtly satisfying to behold , as it spins its simple story in flashback . all this drama is played out quietly . the the film ends abruptly and magnificently , without a summation of what might happen to david . how this child grew up during that period of transitional southern history , in a climate of racial bigotry and christian hypocrisy , in a family with obvious economic , psychological , and cultural problems , sets the mood for this dramatic story . the cinematography was beautifully done . gena rowlands was impressive in a very subtle performance . jacob tierney as david , gave his character softness and breath in a laconic performance . the only problem i have with his performance , is that since this is his life story being told , he seems to be too emotionless . i found that hard to fathom ; if it was me on that nighttime train , alone , going to who knows where , as my brief life passes before me , i would have certainly been more animated about the situation i was in . this film is not davies' best film , it was too dull at times for that ; but , it is a solid film , an honestly done effort that was well-researched and presented . it offered an interesting observation about the rural south , that is often filmed , but most of the time , it is done with less tact than how it was done here and with less of a real artistic touch .
rating:2 a brilliant , witty mock documentary of jean seberg , that puts words in her mouth that she might have approved of , but did not actually say , these are mark rappaport's words . she was to appear in many films afterward , but her best role might have been in a film few people saw or cared about , lilith . this film challenges our credibility , it offers a fascinating look at the world of make believe and the politics of the times , telling us secrets that may or may not be true . it also enlightens us that seberg's stare into the camera was basically a no-no for an actor to do at that time , but is now acceptable , making her a trend setter . this is a clever film , immensely satisfying and enjoyable ; and , fortunately , the director casts jean in a favorable light , she seems to deserve that .
rating:1 everything seen is what has become a clich ? for this genre . i missed you . the film ends smoothly like those mystery shows on tv do : with a car chase that seems to be obligatory filler for such cop films , a rescue coming just in the nick of time , and the action scenes being well choreographed to fit the pyrotechnical finale . the attempt to bring any psychology into this thriller , never materializes , except in the most banal manner . in fact , the killer is more interested in playing mind games with spader than he is in killing his victims , which convinced me that this film wasn't looking to go into new territory with this 'let's make a profit for the producers' genre film . this debut feature by the music video director joe charbanic is a limited venture , smacking of formula questions and answers to the serial killer's mental state , resulting in a picture that is decidedly painted by-the-numbers . james spader as the lead , most of his career a fine actor , has difficulty doing anything with his uninteresting and predictable role , except go with the props he's been handed . the film covers up its banal story by some pretty slick shooting devices , which include fast-paced editing and jump-cuts , and at times , when taking on the killer's point of view , making the beautiful color go grainy with a hand-held video camera , which is meant to signify that there is some kind of mystery going on . what the sleek looking film accomplishes , is that it makes this hollow film very watchable , looking much like an mtv video . the film ultimately fails because the story is never drawn out enough to make it spellbinding or tense , the main characters are both too hackneyed to bring something to the table except an exercise in playing a role that goes against their film career typecasting .
rating:2 french director eric rohmer's third film is a coming-of-age story , comically looking at the human condition . the beauty in the film is in the natural way the slight story evolves and how tense it gets when love and desire become the main topics that are burning in these very ordinary characters' minds . rohmer is making sport of the adults and how phony they are . the only one who talks with a straight tongue is pauline . the charm in the story is how after all the gossip and lies and perversions pauline sees , she grows up that summer and sees through all the deceits of the adults . rohmer does it without a strong plot but by his ability to have the characters play out who they are in a realistic way , letting their words and actions become examples of how they really are . only pauline comes through this vacation with a worthwhile summer romance . the pleasure in the film is in its simplicity , even if it is not that deep of a story . the natural way it was filmed makes it a pleasant viewing experience , probably reminding the viewer of some similar experience they might have had on the beach .
rating:2 a thrilling but shamelessly manipulative political thriller , the second feature dealing with presidential politics from the director who was once a film critic , rod lurie ( deterrence ) . he has vastly honed his skills as a filmmaker in comparison with his debut film , which was a failure artistically and commercially . " the contender " is a film that is grounded in having a clear understanding of how politically underhanded and sly the system is and how those in it operate on a level that would make machiavelli proud of them . i was taken aback by how great the entire ensemble cast is , with the leads being superb in getting the maximum out of their juicy roles , even if they have to chew the scenery to do it . the cast is so good that it overcomes the shrill oratory , the manipulative , obvious and unbelievable political situations , and an ending that tries to play it so safe , that it takes away the juice in the story that gave this film its power in the first place . i thoroughly enjoyed it , even though i knew it was a manipulative film , trying to get me to bite at its revelations about the double-standards between men and women politicians , without giving me a fair chance to swallow everything without choking on what i was asked to swallow . this only occurs when he orders something ordinary -- a muenster cheese sandwich . there was something about that action that didn't seem right . it will later on play an important part in the film's plot . it makes the viewer face the fact that a woman in high office is still a woman and has to be accepted just like a man in that position would be . hanson refuses to comment on the issue , taking the high moral ground , saying it is no one's business but her own . senator hanson is seen as both a liberal and a vegetarian . the story in itself is more soap opera than drama , but what gives it verve is the super performances from the three stars , jeff bridges , gary oldman , and joan allen . they give depth to their roles and they are all seen in many different lights and shades . jeff bridges steals every scene he is in , offering a fascinating look at a president who could be likable though sinister , sneakily clever , and also very politically human in a generous and gracious way . he was thoroughly believable as an updated bill clinton-type , post-lewinsky . this film is a pro-clinton one , taking aim at those who dig up dirt and cast aspersions in a hypocritical way , when it is evident that both sides are capable of using the same bag of dirty tricks to further their own cause . the film was fascinating when it didn't have a message to deliver with some bogus pat speech and , instead , set up a logical argument showing that senator hanson should be confirmed for office despite allegations of her youthful sex scandal .
rating:1 the film wavers between being a philosophical treatise on women and being about a woman's passions without resolving what any contemporary woman's magazine currently does ( this unresolvement can be seen in both a positive and a negative sense ) . the effort here is to push the film along shock value lines , of pushing it more into the lines of what a porno film does as routine . some of her revelations might surprise the opposite sex , as this film is helpful like a self-help book is meant to be . she makes no bones about it that she loves the carnal act . marie's best comment to this is , " why do men who disgust us , understand us best . " she seems to enjoy this perverse relationship , of being degraded , better than all her others , as we see her with robert in this situation twice . despite the film's coldness , lack of humor , bleak conceptions about relationships , unappetizing sexual scenes , lack of dramatic tension , and pretentious philosophizing by caroline ducey , it still had something disturbing to say about relationships that was worth listening to . for the director , sex is shown to be what fantasies are made of : that it is all in one's head . to show this , breillat her heroine be nude for many scenes and therefore symbolically stripped her of all the illusions she has about sex , as we watch her act out these fantasies . though the film might not always be appealing , it is still not a work of trash ; it does have something to say of what goes on in the marital bedroom . how much you like what it says might depend on what you thought it was digging at and if its romantic notions rang a bell in your head . my thoughts are that the film's presentation didn't particularly excite me , but afterwards it left me thinking about what it had to say about relationships , which are still just as great a mystery as god is , and i began to warm to the film more than while i was watching it . it , somehow , made me think more about the dark side of a relationship and for that reason alone , i wouldn't entirely dismiss this film , though i wonder at what it really was trying to get at . the body of the film's works is quite different than its ending , which shows ducey giving birth to a son and her womanhood supposedly being fulfilled . i think this is a film women might be more appreciative than men .
rating:3 this is an unsentimental and marvelously acted family drama , set in a backwater dumpy australian seacoast town . the script by laura jones is intelligent and pertinent , the woman director gillian armstrong ( my brilliant career ) has made a nearly flawless film , and the three lead actresses draw out their complicated characters in ways that touch the heart with the mark of unbridled reality . the film doesn't flinch and tells the story without leaving a way out for any of the parties involved . it shows that a mother doesn't have to be perfect , she can have flaws as almost all do , but there's something about a child being raised by her real mother that means so much to both . there are no easy answers given here , what the film does best is concentrate on how this accidental meeting has a devastating effect on all three lives and it does it in a fresh way . judy davis is one of the best actresses around today , and her performance is powerful . this is just a brilliant film , my only quibble with it is a minor one .
rating:1 an entertaining nonsense film from aip , directed by the master of the meaningless , edward l . cahn . it is one of those mad scientist in the jungle movies , that is so bad , that it becomes funny to watch to see just how bad it is . there's some savagely inane dialogue , which should add a chuckle or two . he replies , " never say that again . " and with dialogue like that and cheap looking props , as the film was obviously shot as cheaply as possible in the studio , there is no reason in the world to take this flick seriously . it makes no attempt to make things look realistic , and its story doesn't even try to make sense . she says , " what's in it for you here , the usual ! if you can accept the film on it own low level terms , this studio jungle film might be your medicine .
rating:2 in his forceful and blunt way , hiding his violent tendencies with the warmest smile in st . petersburg , he professes to have a real romantic interest in her , sincerely sympathizing with her that men are often beating her up . she seems to so passively accept her beatings as part of her life , which i guess is symbolic of how russia treats its women . everything that we learn about the new russian attitudes comes from seeing it through danila's naive eyes . this scene for one thing tells how xenophobic the russians have always been and still are . his mindlessness and quiet charm , and the heroic qualities he often displays , are both chilling and pitiful to observe . if anything , this slickly done gangster thriller , should be taken as a political warning by the west that russia is a wounded animal and still dangerous , and a wounded animal is frightened and will often do anything to lash out at those it perceives as hurting it . there were many diverting scenes that make that point crystal clear . his performance gives the film a reverberating force , depicting the chaos currently going on in a deteriorating country , and how difficult it would be to reach someone like him , when he can be so deceptive by just smiling and so distant by tuning out what he doesn't want to hear . it is in his soul that rests the centuries of russia's life of misery and war , whose struggle is never over but always seems to be just beginning . he has infused the film with a raw power , that touches the nerves of the things that westerners understand the least about the russians . all this makes for a fascinating film , one that is popular in russia , and is quite different from the usual russian films exported to america . it is one of the most insightful films i have seen about modern russia and how organized crime has taken a foothold in the country . it is a film that has its finger on the problems the severe economic decay in russia and the rise of criminals to fill the void of a lost morality , has caused . this film has the look and tone of those old american b movies , but with a little more depth in its political aims and much more pessimism for its country'sfuture .
rating:0 open secret is a quality story , but is a cheaply produced b-film with similar themes about anti-semitism as " crossfire " and " gentleman's agreement . " this is one of the rare occasions that leonard played a cop instead of a gangster . the story should hold your interest .
rating:1 that is how the film got its title of " the chase . " it was a fascinating scene , darkly capturing the tortured mind of chuck and the stifling atmosphere of cuba during the mid-forties . this film noir is memorable for its dark , dream-like feel , as reality becomes indistinguishable from the dream sequences . because of those shots , this film became a cult classic ; but , it is one that is rarely shown on tv . they specialize in dark and expressionistic works , which this film is perfect example of .
rating:2 it featured a young cast , hungry to make its mark in films . this surprisingly realistic war drama , caught a dark side to the war in a very personal way that very few films have captured . the film had the same gritty feel to it that sam fuller's " the steel helmet " had , but the emphasis here is more on a psychological nature than fuller's cultural one . endore is one of those people who can't live by the rules , considering them to be mostly unnecessary . on a personal level , the psychological effects of the war are seen through the conflict between loomis and endore . the sheer black-and-white photography caught the expansive mood of the troops in the battlefield , and its grainy quality helped the viewer see the war in a personalized way , as in the scene where the idealist loomis is fighting for his survival in a hand-to-hand fight with a chinese soldier . this is a wonderfully maddening film . there couldn't be a more pronounced statement about the insanity of war than this gritty film offers , as seen mainly through the dead-pan eyes of a psychopath .
rating:2 cecilia roth , the wonderful argentinian-born actress , is the focal point of the film and it is fair to say that her outstanding performance tries to portray what the director wants to say about the nature of motherhood . in this film there is little difference between what is real and what is fake . this is the 13th pedro almod ? var film i have seen , one that many critics say shows the aging , enfant terrible director maturing , becoming kinder and gentler , showing a capacity for making a film with more of a conventional plot and being less interested in shocking his audience as he once loved to do . but the shock is still there , enough of it to keep it from becoming a mainstream film . to visually show her path back and forth from barcelona to madrid , there is a stunningly photographed tunnel looking very much like a womb , with a train racing through it . though the film has a pungency to it , there are just too many scenes where the wit seems forced and doesn't flow in the natural rhythm of the story . the film is filled with many references and homages to other hollywood films and to writers , something that is both good and bad . it is good because too many films are devoid of any intellectual influences . bad because the references are overused here , making the director's gushy homages too syrupy for my taste buds . but he doesn't know that . this is a story about many different things : its subplots could take you into areas such as organ donors , aids , coincidences , family relationships , family values , and the affects of pop culture on the public ( take note of that hilarious diaper commercial , an actual one shown on spanish tv ) ; but , the film's main premises were about : praising actresses , praising motherhood , praising sexual ambiguity , and praising the kindness from strangers ( tolerance of all people seems to be the strongest message emanating from the film ) . the mixed feelings i got about the film come from my not being sure if this film is meant to be taken as a parody or a tragic soap opera . there were times i didn't know whether i was supposed to laugh at all this or cry . this film is melodramatic in the tradition of the douglas sirk nuclear family romantic rock hudson and dorothy malone ones of the 1950s , but with almod ? var , it becomes even a weepier one , one that is mostly outrageous , one whose family nature is more ambiguous and certainly not nuclear . it is a film that is paradoxical : men can be actresses also . the deftness of the cinematography and the array of colors displayed are simply dazzling . this film could be enjoyed solely for its bright orange , red and yellow patterns , giving the eye a startling light show to feast on , as the camera is constantly moving from one thing of beauty to another . it is worth noting , that there is no criticism by the director for any of his characters , no matter how they screw things up . the problem with all this adulation is that all the flattery has a hollow ring to it , it is just too good to be true , and his characters are not completely believable because of this . the film's strength lies in the emotions of the characters ; their close-ups revealing an inner strength in them , that no matter what they've been through , they will stick together and not succumb to their overwhelming problems . a pregnant nun in an almod ? var film shouldn't be that surprising to his fans , in fact what else should they expect ! this is another of the director's themes , of how the ones who are supposed to be normal and try so hard to convey that impression , are really fakes , while the ones who are considered to be oddballs in society , could be the normal ones , who are at least living out their fantasies . the hurt look on rosa's face after her father leaves , gives us a picture of her thought process that is better than dialogue , it is one that is worth savoring . there is one scene when agrado announces that the performance of " streetcar . . . " of course , this clears most of the audience out , with those few remaining being mostly the young and more daring ones , the same audience that has sustained the director over the years . she proceeds to tell how he got put together into a she and how much each part cost , in a comic bit that seemed , at least it did to me , that the director was trying to please his audience too much . trying the actors were all splendid . i was particularly impressed by marisa paredes' subtle but invigorating performance . the aging actress had a certain air about her that invigorated every scene she was in , showing how vulnerable and engaging an actress she is . but when the spotlight was on marisa , what the director was trying to say about actresses' had a clarity about it that didn't seem forced . but still , what makes an almod ? var film special , is his eye for visual effects . i haven't seen a more stunning visual film all year ( it is comparable to kubrick's " eyes wide shut " ) . i was so dazzled by the visuals , that the film's metaphors , bizarre tale , and great actors , seem to take second place to the visual splendor of the film . as good as this film is , one of the problems almod ? var still has , is that he can't make his outrageous characters distinguishable from caricatures . this cloy act of his does not make agrado any more compelling . one must give almod ? var credit for getting his voice heard in the mainstream while keeping his artististic integrity intact . that is not an easy thing to do and the director has used the popular vehicle of hollywood melodrama to add his own sense of culture and literary references to it , despite the differences i have with his approach to the characters and their development . the film's story line is ludicrous but the hurt the characters receive as perceived by them is real . almod ? var retains in this work an intriguing call for the bizarre , that keeps the film from descending toward being a hollywood one . but it also never reaches great artistic heights . there are no breakthroughs in character study . this is basically still a message film . a most amusing and diverting portrayal of the sexually ambiguous , but not a great film . the critical success of this film makes for strange bedfellows , when the 'chic' cannes crowd hooted in disappointment that the film wasn't chosen as the best one in the festival , but cheered when almod ? var won for best director , they now might be considered as part of the usual almod ? var fan base of weirdoes and independent-minded movie goers , a fan base that seems to be growing to accomodate a different type of enthusiast , one that is more establishment orientated .
rating:1 this is a film that uses the porn business as its background , but is really about the loneliness and the corruption of an individual . this low-budget indie is mostly a character study of how 'an ordinary guy' such as paul could descend into the seedy world of porno all because he doesn't know how to get a date . he rationalizes his plight by saying in a voiceover , " my parents said sex is a bad thing . " he reasons the quality of the commercial porno films is so poor , he can easily make better films . the film had an anti-septic and unsexy look to it , as its sex scenes were not erotic . it seemed like a film made by outsiders , who took easy shots at the sleaze industry . the film had little emotional impact even though the story was exploitive and aimed to get sympathy for its victims .
rating:1 a fine looking , but extremely lightweight satire from tom dicillo ( living in oblivion , box of moonlight ) . i could not take this satirical comedy as a serious work of satire , as the story is rife with unresolved issues it brings up just to be seemingly ironical but with not enough conviction or intensity of purpose to make something out of its mocking tone , that is attacking both the television and fashion industry . all the characters are busy pursuing their goals to succeed in the image-oriented fashion industry or in the cheesy video and tv soap opera markets of new york . unfortunately , the satire has little bite to it . dicillo couldn't make up his mind what he wanted to do , so the characters end up as being viewed as satires of themselves . i'm sure no one in the " industry " is going to be too taken aback by this film's attack on them . but the audience will see a well crafted film , that is pleasant to watch , but with hardly any laughs to garner from it . their story is what is supposed to tug at our heart strings and also make us laugh , as they try and handle all the obstacles they are up against . this seems to make them out to be more real than bob and sahara ; at least , in their eyes . it succeeded in telling their side of the story . the only thing is that their story was not that different from those who were depicted as being superficial . this was especially amusing because joe had to betray all his lofty views just to get this vulgar job , before losing it because he mouths off to an ignorant assistant director . but all the film added up to , was an easy to watch , slick nyc life-style satirical story about those trying to make it in the glamor business , told by an interesting director who tried to say something more than what was actually said .
rating:1 also , the locations are gorgeous ( actual location shots are in ecuador's quito wilderness ) and the escapist story about kidnap-and-ransom has enough of a tinge of realism to catch one's interest . . . but all that is still not enough to stop the thinly plotted story from dragging in spots , bringing on a dullness to its critical life-and-death situations , and falling into clich ? territory from the get-go , as the film failed to be anything but trite -- a film that tried desperately to have a heart , but all it has to show for its effort is that it looks like a typical hollywood action film , something tried and marketed many times before . a good film to rest your brain cells and get carried away by the star's screen presence . and , if you do not judge the film on a more critical standard , i think you'll get your money's worth , that is , if you're in the market for seeing a beautiful looking escapist film . that flat rambo-like chopper rescue is a rehearsal for the expected rescue that will set the scene for the film's payoff , showing us beforehand what terry is capable of doing . it made for dull film fare , even though it smacked of some semblance of truth . this film just got butchered because it was unable to be imaginative and make its exciting plot line come alive . it just stalls and falls into a rather trite escapade into the jungles to rescue an american engineer from revolutionaries who are caricatured as being stupid , cruel , lazy , and high on drugs . their romance was forgettable , leaving me feeling too distant from the lovers and their flirtatious romance . it certainly didn't have the impact of the romantic parting in " casablanca , " an ending this film tried to emulate . the film just didn't have too much juice in its hackneyed story , or in its generalized characterization of revolutionaries , oil moguls , and heroes .
rating:3 it is about the effects of war on some taiwanese patriots and appears to be inaccessible until it slowly becomes clear what the masterful director is up to . the story is multi-layered as it uses as its theme the crimes against citizens during the anti-communist campaign waged during the 1950s , giving it a complexity that requires the viewer to have a resolve to stick with this gloomy tale that is shot with a static camera and takes place in three different time periods ( past , present , and in the imagination ) . the reward is seeing a great bit of filmmaking that comes from the heart . this is being enacted in a film starring liang ching . as the red army fought for control of china , chiang kai-shek -- supported by the americans -- rooted out all communists by force . the movie's title she's in is : good men , good women . the film offers much to ponder about the lessons from the past and how rotten both sides can be during war . it's a smoothly accomplished film of a 'film within a film , ' as it uses memories that are personal and those that are part of history to show how we can't easily distinguish the two . by the film's conclusion we feel the personal loss of both men who were killed , even though one might have been an innocent victim and the other might have got what he deserved . it's an unusual film that is always challenging and intelligent . annie shizuka inoh in the role of these women from different generations , gives an inspiring performance that evokes a genuine sympathy .
rating:1 a clich ? heist-gone-sour movie by the british filmmaker antonia bird that has a raw look to it but little else to recommend it . it was bloody , filled with violent action scenes that should please the kind of audience that gravitates toward that sort of thing , and most of all it was very aggressive in attitude without much to say about anything but the criminals . it aimed for style and a maddening fast pace and got both--which makes it entertaining . but the film fails to get you to care for any of these characters , though it tries hard to get you to believe that ray is not a bad guy . this action film is all action and the talk is all cockney , which makes it hard for an american audience to understand . this gutsy crime film with political overtones fails to be convincing . it was not possible for me to believe carlyle has any political insight , never mind him being an idealist . it just seems like another mindless film in a long list of streetwise crime stories that are now hard to remember because they all seem to run together . incidentally , the film's title face--is a cockney term for a gangster .
rating:3 he feels compelled to always have a gun , as it makes him feel important . but in this expressionist-like opening scene , it is shown that bart will have little chance of overcoming his obsession . it now becomes a road movie of a crime spree , or a love-on-the run film . bart comments : " two people dead , just so we can live without working ! " the swamp was used because this low-budget film couldn't afford the money to pay extras and the swamp scene would require only a limited cast . as film noir , this hard-boiled story is much superior to the more popular and more critically acclaimed " bonnie and clyde , " which covered the same territory story-wise : amour fou- the running away together by lovers . this fast-action film , with its typically notorious femme fatale depicted , is subversive to the nth degree . he complimented films of this kind by endearingly calling them , " perceptive trash . " whatever weakness the story had as it waivered between art and entertainment , and even if it was acted by not the most accomplished of actors , yet there was a raw innocence about it creating a special kind of appeal to those who could feel its lively pulse beating to their resentment of the establishment .
rating:1 this charlie chan episode lacked humor , as there was no number one son present . but despite being a bit dry , it applied the usual formula methods and proved to be entertaining .
rating:2 everyone knows how bad it is to be called a chicken--it could mess up one's self-image worst than the wind can mess up a ducktail haircut for a teenager in the 1950s--as this liberal-inspired social commentary film plunges right into that 1950s eisenhower era mind-set , without trepidation . it's a film that sympathetically sides with the rebellious youths and their befuddled parents , and it doesn't even demonize the police . it airs out the prevalent problems of the mid-'50s for these youngsters ; such as , loneliness , alienation , lack of love , fitting in with their peers , their identity crises , and the lack of communication with their folks . all these well-off kids ride to school together in this open car , acting loud and stupid , proud to be dumb americans . for all its aging and the changing mores of the times and the ever-increasing complexities of modern youth , this creaky film still has a rawness about it , something that is intangible , that gets into your spine and brings out a chill or two , that tells you this dramatization was real .
rating:1 this innocent comedy from spain just didn't have enough impact to hit a home run with its humor . it probably has more relevancy for its native audience ( at least , i hope it does ) , as most of its tv sitcom sketches just didn't register with my domestic comedy/romance antenna . the film's main asset is its popular star , carmen maura , considered by many spanish film critics to be spain's most accomplished actress . if you like that sort of comedy , then you might like this film . the story is probably autobiographical : the heroine ( carmen maura ) is a journalist named carmen , and the film is layed out in four sections , just like a newspaper , but here the divisions relate to the time of season . all the fights are mild and over the most trivial of things , which is supposed to make this very materially comfortable couple look ridiculous , since it is obvious that they have so much going for them that there is no reason for them to be fighting all the time . she then tells him , " the watch only looks expensive , it was really quite cheap . " somehow the film flew by , aided by its breezy pace , non-stop banter , and the lightheartedness of its direction . it was a sweet , palpable , likable little domestic comedy , similar to what american audiences saw on tv in the 1950s and 1960s ( except for the nudity and frank sexual talk ) . carmen maura put on a good show , outwitting the episodic script and coming to terms with her great mid-life crisis in a pleasing manner . it's a mild film , with mild comedy , and mild points to make about domestic relations . it is deserving of mild praise for its execution .
rating:1 a terrific cast does not necessarily make for a good pic . the film becomes ridiculous by the time of that unbelievable romance on the run and by its finale it becomes a hopeless mess . though , it's entertaining as it takes us into the modern commercial art world and pretentiously shows what it takes to be a modern artist , let's us eyeball jodie foster in the nude , and has dennis hopper do his usual eccentric character number--this time as a hit man who wants to be loved and play the sax like charlie parker . he will then give anne a choice : i finish you now , or i let you live and you belong to me . it ends with a bunch of silly action scenes involving a helicopter chase and an oil refinery explosion . since none of it made too much sense , the fun to be found in this largely improvised flick is to see if you can get some laughs from how absurd it is . since i only got a mild dosage of laughter out of it , i was only mildly pleased with the flick . originally made for european release under the title catchfire , backtrack wasn't given a general distribution until 1991 . but in 1991 it was given back some cut film footage and released on cable . i would have hated to see the film when it made less sense than it did now .
rating:1 this irish crime charmer has 'the gift of gab . ' it's a shaggy-dog type of story , filled with colorful characters and the color of the irish countryside . the film should be valued for its amusing dialogue , despite the difficulty to understand what is being said because of the thick brogues . maybe , he's just a good guy , or a bit naive , or perhaps he is a bit short on smarts . it is mostly a road movie , showing what it's like to bring frank back to dublin . there are a lot of sudden twists in the story that keep you guessing as to what happens next . the violent conclusion is done with style and adds to the comic mood the film set . it is a rather cheerful film-- despite the violence , the lowlife characters , and all the peat bogs the duo come across . it also has something to say about being loyal as opposed to being greedy . its ethics are blurred by what society considers right and wrong , but by going over that line of decency , the film gains most of its charm .
rating:1 a thoughtless formula movie about street racers , that moves so fast from one scene to the next it could be geared for those who suffer from add ( attention defecit disorder ) ; it should give you a few jolts and cinematic thrills , but the price paid is that logic is the first thing thrown out of the car window . the theme of this summertime movie could be that there's little difference in morality between criminals and undercover cops , and that's probably giving the film too much credit for thinking about anything but the box office . it's all about racing cars that seem like rockets when equipped with nitrous oxide ; it's the driving scenes that keep you from nodding off and since they use real cars , with real stunt riders , that's what grabs your attention throughout and makes you a captive of this meaningless but childishly fun tale . the film's best attempt at dialogue goes something like this . . . first place racer ( diesel ) : " it don't matter if you win by an inch or by a mile ; winning's winning . " but if you don't mind being taken for a mindless adrenaline ride across the glittering blacktops of los angeles , this could be excused as a guilty pleasure treat . this was exciting but meaningless stuff ; there was no artistic accomplishment derived from this by-the-numbers action pic . the acting can't be faulted , but it was left on the skidmarks on the road , as this script was too inane to provide any realistic characterizations . the two women had badly underwritten parts , walker was forgettable in his role , and diesel was all high-octane energy , acting either angry or looking tough with his shaved head while constantly flexing his musles . he gave this film whatever acting charisma it had to have , so at least one human could look as good as the cars . this was the kind of film where you could have walked in for the last 15 minutes and would have had no trouble following the story . it's one of those bad flicks that is irresistible because there's a charge to it that rides through its mundane story and allows it to almost get away with its ludcricous dialogue . the dialogue that made me crack my biggest smile went like this -- dom to brian : " i live my life a quarter-mile at a time , for those 10 seconds , i'm free . " if you are looking for a film about reality or one that has a philosophy , or one that just makes sense , i would avoid this one . but if you want to see a film about people whom you probably wouldn't like if you met them on the road in real-life , but on film you can be tolerant of them and even might find this film oddly enjoyable , then this popcorn movie might taste buttery to you . it has those other recent car movies , driven , gone in sixty seconds , and grand theft auto , beat by a city mile .
rating:1 apparently , the judicial system has broken down , so much so that it can't satisfy the political electorate who want stiffer punishment and those who want more of an emphasis on education and counseling programs for the nonviolent offenders . the prison atmosphere of hostility , constant danger , noise , and inhumanity , was fully captured , as the film had the gritty , realistic look of a prison . the convicts looked scary , the prison looked real , and the feeling of despair was the only air that was present , as rehabilitation seemed to be a farce , a show that one puts on to score clemency points from the judges . the acting was just fine . i don't know if anyone seriously believes anymore that the prisons can be a place of rehabilitation . the film does a very good job in bringing this out and creating an entertaining picture because of the fine performances . but it also seemed to stage everything in the story to weigh heavily into what its message was . the film didn't feel like it was freely flowing along , and because of that the story floundered at times .
rating:1 a splendid tv movie remake of fritz lang's 1941 man hunt . o'toole's performance is the thing here . why he does it is only given a fuzzy interpretation . clive donner makes o'toole grow into a character that is larger than his country , playing off his petulance , his wit and charm , against his daring skills to look death in the eye and heroically escape his pursuers . what the filmmaker does , is have o'toole make great scenes out of conventional ones . even though o'toole is the one trapped in the hole , the major seems to be the one suffocating on the truth , even as he puts on an air of decorum and lays it into his captive , his talk just sounds like jabbering when compared to o'toole's . in this film , not being able to talk properly , means that you are more of an animal than an animal is .
rating:2 the story is funny , somewhat romantic , though at times resembling more a tv series like columbo than a movie , but in the end turns back to the private eye genre it started out in . i thoroughly enjoyed this uncanny and inventive caper , except for the unconvincing acting between pullman and kim ( she was too lethargic ) -- which made it difficult for me to get involved with their relationship . zero had a light heartedness about it that was endearing and worthy of that mind solving sherlock holmes genre it so alluringly wanted to emulate , but too lacking in overall integrity to achieve more of an original tone to it , than turn out to be a reasonably witty film , achieved under the direction of the young son of the famous film director .
rating:2 sacha vierny , as cinematographer , supplies the film with striking visuals , every scene is beautiful to behold . the technicolors of favor for the film are the different shades of brown resembling the marvelous architecture in rome and the pure shades of white , which tend to introduce the characters in their best light , before it becomes apparent that they are all obnoxious to a certain degree and not as pure as they first might have seemed . this film like all greenaway productions , is a splendid visual film to behold . the film might not add up to much in weight , but the sum of its parts were like an apple hitting newton on his noggin . it had one mesmorizing visual scene after another , and gave one enough fodder to think about all the spiritual and corporeal themes it just spread before your eyes without going further into them . greenaway , as always , is an acquired taste .
rating:3 rivette has created a work of art from a short balzac story about art , " the unfinished masterpiece . " it is just something she does so she could be independent of nicolas . la belle noiseuse , which we are told , is the title of the masterpiece , is about a 17th century lady of the world who was kind of nutty in the sense that she was difficult to figure out , who is referred to as being someone who is a " ball-buster . " what makes for a captivating depiction of an artist at work , are scenes such as these , where one's sense of time is lost , and the length of the picture , ( it is 240 minutes ) does not seem wasted even for a minute , as we watch and become part of the creation , starting from scratch , and actually are hearing the artist's scratching sounds on the canvas for minutes at a time with no action on the screen but to view him work and watch him manipulate the model into the pose he wants , even when she complains that he is hurting her . frenhofer is stuck . he is filled with self-doubt if he can ever paint again . marianne asks him , " why " me " naked in front of you , why not liz " ? she goes on to say , " i need to understand this " . . . it seems the situation has reached a point of no return . every character is now playing out his emotional trump cards . there is a hint of a possible affair that might have taken place between balthazar and her ten- years ago , that seems to be the cause of the tension we feel among the three of them . liz says , " for freno , it is the art of it , it is the capturing of a whole life in a painting--- it is that thing that makes art shameless , that is what matters to him . it is as if one can see one's whole life passing in a flash , like it might be for a person drowning . " so the camaraderie between the two artists seems to be genuinely plausible , in the sense , that they do understand each other , that is , as far as their work goes . with freno , in the position of control in his life , he is able to patronizingly say to nicolas as he departs , " i like you , don't ever change . " the last shot is with the agent , talking numbers with frenhofer , deciding how much they will get for the masterpiece . the acting is exceptionally good by everyone . piccoli as the artist is mesmerizing , while emmanuelle is both beautiful and intelligent , offering a special quality about her that makes it possible for us to believe that a masterpiece could come out of her poses . the only thing that struck me as odd , is that the final masterpiece drawn , supposedly by bernard dufour , did not appear to me to be a masterpiece , but a rather ordinary work . the picture itself is the masterpiece ; that is , the creative process itself , was convincingly done , by a director who has the skills and knowledge to tell such a story and never allow the story to be wavering from its lofty position of significance , as anything but an honest intellectual effort , a search for the truth within .
rating:0 this very predictable social drama will have every character be a walking clich ? , every major event be a contrived one , and it will do everything it could do to convince the audience that assimilation is the way to go , but get out on the pulpit and preach against racial hatred . it is good to have such tolerant beliefs , don't get me wrong , but to make such a boring and muddled picture about it , is not a good thing . the film's themes about religious fanatics , family problems , prostitution , hypocrisy , jealousy over a friend's success , the immigration problem , bigotry , the problems a young man has in growing up , a father-son frictional relationship , social hierarchy , male abuse towards women , the tribulations of a workaholic , love , loneliness , the need for warmth , and cultural clashes , are just too many themes for one film to have . the filmmaker is all over the cricket field with these problems , but just can't make this long list of problems have any lasting interest for the film goer . and , as if these weren't enough problems , some more come up when the taxi driver takes as his fare , a german industrialist , stellan skarsg ? rd , who goes by the name of schitz ( you can see for yourself what goes for humor here , as you try to pronounce that name ) . when it comes down to the nitty-gritty of things , this uncompelling film can't make up its mind on how it stands on some of the major issues it brings to the table . by the film's end i don't know how to feel about parvez's romance with the prostitute , as it certainly breaks up his family life but gives him a temporary renewed self-respect and hope . for me , it was just an unbelievable scene , and to boot , it didn't clear up anything about the mainstream moslem official position on the negativity toward prostitution . in fact , i didn't learn anything about moslems except to see them as the stereotypes they are most of the time depicted as in most other mainstream films . om puri ( in custody/city of joy/target ) is an accomplished actor from india , whose trademark face and ability to be very expressive and exuberant , engages the film with his sense of what it is to be a decent person . there is something about him that identifies with those who are outsiders , as long as they are not fanatics or troublemakers . but the filmmaker doesn't even attempt to play fair , the story is told totally from his point of view , all the others around him are one-dimensional characters , who are not only uninteresting but they are for the most part made to appear annoying . that parvez is a decent guy , with a good attitude , is probably not as true as the filmmaker thinks . that this film doesn't have the power to say anything important that hasn't been heard many times before , is my take on it . but the worst thing about this film , is that it is a snoozer , not able to make its story about the virtues of being faithful to your culture and your wife come to life , as it is mired down in one clich ? after another . the best thing to say about this art- house type of film , is that it should upset no one : it is so bland and unexciting that it is hard to tell what all the fuss is about . there was just nothing here to get worked up about . i just assume people immigrate to western countries to earn a better living , there is no big deal in exposing that . but , you can be sure of one thing , this moslem filmmaker did not pull a salman rushdie with this film .
rating:1 director joseph l . mankiewicz switched greene's anti-american premise around and made it an anti-communism theme , which was to the detriment of the film as it seemed to lose its potent messages . mankiewicz turns it into a feeble murder mystery and an uninvolving romantic love triangle , which is told in flashback . the film was shot in magnificent shades of black and white , and it was filmed on location in vietnam giving it a look of authencity .
rating:1 it's not possible to write this review without revealing the key problematic elements of the film , though i believe these spoilers will not ruin the viewing of this film ; yet , some might prefer to read the review after seeing the film . this makes for a grim drama that is intelligently directed by actor tim roth , in his first directorial effort , as adapted from the novel by alexander stuart , who also did the screenplay ; the performances as well as the photography of the haunting countryside are first-rate , but nothing particularly insightful materializes about this sexually abusive situation . somehow after all the grimness of this story plays out and we see all the graphic details , the story still doesn't grab us emotionally as much as we wanted it to . the tension slowly builds in a household that appears outwardly as a loving one , until it reaches its expected boiling point . this doesn't leave the audience much room to do anything but gasp at the shameful situation presented and the dirty little secret that too many families find themselves in and can't deal with .
rating:2 this is raimi's attempt to go mainstream with an art film thriller that might have an appeal to an audience that likes films that give them some ideas to ponder . this wintry morality tale , its bleak snowbound midwestern atmosphere reminds me a lot of fargo , without the comedy , as it examines the character of three small town locals who have no worldly experience , but have adjusted in one way or another to their lot in life . billy bob is particularly outstanding in his true-to-life characterization of such an individual . but as a result , her interference makes things worse . this is a dilemma for the filmmakers , there seems to be something devoid about this tale that can't surface , except in outwardly visual terms , as we clearly see how morality is drawn in terms of black and white . there is the great shot of the snow in all its whiteness and the black crows surrounding the downed plane , as this sighting of where the money is seems to be a symbol for the film's morality play . the result of all the trio's bungling , is that things are no longer simple for them , as greed and their extended version of the american dream , but this time earned the too easy way , via a suitcase full of money found in the snow , becomes too much for them to handle with any sensibility , as all their character flaws become magnified , and they begin to get careless and talk too much of what they found . this is a strong gut-wrenching suspense film , one of the top ten of 1998 . but the film is just lacking something , and i think that thing it needed , was a breath of vagueness about what is morally right or wrong in order for the story to remain on an even psychological/spiritual keel and not descend into a literal biblical morality theme . raimi did a superb visual job , carefully weaving a noir tale without any heroes or apparent villains , a difficult task to do , but one that he succeeds in without question . my feeling is , that in due time , we will look back at this film and wonder how it was overlooked by so many , as it will become recognized as one of the great suspense classics .
rating:1 a slight melodramatic story , but an efficiently made moral tale with noir overtures . this film does a good job of poking holes at that dream , showing underneath the surface all is not well . but the nightmare indicates more than that , as it indicates there is something troubling even the youngsters brought up in this so-called ideal materialistic environment .
rating:3 that ahmed goes on to the next village , despite warnings of not to go , is a metaphor for how a childlike curiousity and a refreshing innocense is the essential ingredient needed , if change is ever to come to a society that is stagnant . the narrowness of life and the barren landscape , are excellent props for the director's vibrant themes , shot without professional actors and done in a low key , realistic style . the aims of this film are set too low to make it a masterpiece , especially when you compare it to a satyajit ray film , but this is still great cinema , something american filmmakers would be wise to observe . his relentless pursuit is poetically evocative , depicting life in its raw elements . what more can you ask for ?
rating:3 this is a visually appealing hong kong ghost story film , that is highly stylized , told from the perspective of a courtesan , anita mui ( fleur ) . the film is evocative ; its strength lying mostly in its poetical presentation , as it masterfully weaves a visual work of great scope and intelligence . the essence of the story does not depend on whether you believe in ghosts or not , though it would help if you would not be entirely reluctant to accept the possiblity that there could be a life-after-death . fleur , still dressed as a 1930s courtesan would be dressed , appears out of place in this modern capitalistic society , that has forgotten not only its ancient roots but its recent past . this film fascinated me on many levels , but mainly , it made me wonder about unfulfilled expectations in this world and how the netherworld could really exist as a domain for such things that remain unresolved . it allows us the opportunity to ask ourselves , if we can really believe in spiritual things without being spiritual ? is there something worth dying for ? this is truly one of the best films to come out of hong kong in the modern era . even its ironical ending , is handled with great dignity and care ; and , even if , you are not convinced by the logic of this super-natural tale , the beauty of its characterization is enough to make up for any shortcomings you might have thought this film had , such as the improbability of such vivid ghosts being so openly seen by everyone .
rating:0 the mild attempt , in this b- film , to be a convincing noir film , never materializes , as the film looks more like a sophomoric attempt to imitate the genre than the real thing . there is no feeling for characters or intensity in this story , it looks contrived from the get-go . all the characters , except for reese's , are slime balls , people we could care less about . so when this film moves into its different plot twists and all kinds of ludicrous situations develop , it wanes in interest , as the characters were never developed and the film has a cheesy look to it . it seems to have the style of a thriller but without the substance . its attempt at humor alluded me .
rating:2 it is adapted from herman melville's 1852 novel pierre ( pola is the acronym of the french title of melville's novel , x stands for the tenth draft of the screenplay which writer/director leos carax completed ) . it is a film about madness and excesses , topics that are always fuzzy to portray on the screen . it's set in modern france though it starts out looking like a romantic 19th century literary work , where its background is a rich , idyllic country setting in normandy of palatial chateaus void of modern traffic . we know it's modern times only because the protagonist rides a motorcycle and uses a computer . this is a unique film , that has an inexplicable brilliance to it that defies reason and its soap opera melodramatics . it is precious film , though parts of it may not be pleasing or deciferable . but there is an intelligence it has about it that should overcome all doubts about its excesses : as the film goes from showing pierre's change from being a self-indulgent aristocrat to his complete breakdown as a self-indulgent raving lunatic .
rating:2 this lyrical film shared with " taste of cherry " the palme d'or for 1997 . it's a virtuous film that after its violent beginning settles down and becomes an amusing and insightful study about a man trying to find himself after spending the last eight years in prison . it is interesting to note how this couple take this murderer into their home , something that would not likely happen in america . though imamura paints yamashita's character as being serious and withdrawn , there are comical interludes which make him seem plain daffy . he explains , that he talks to the eel because he listens to what i say . an interesting film , that works most effectively as an introspective study of how to deal with one's anger and love .
rating:3 it was different in style than other films at the time and was received very well by the critics . the film turned out to be visually satisfying to audiences , though not pleasing all the critics . through all kinds of sexual debasements and perversities that are shown in this poorly received film , pasolini attempted to make his point about current italian society being like fascism . pasolini , the decadent anti-fascist , pro-communist , homosexual artist is a key figure in trying to come to grips with modern italy and its many passions , this documentary provides some useful fodder about him , whether you are a novice to him or have followed his career fully . one thing i can say for sure about pasolini , is that he is always interesting , even if he isn't always understood . this documentary gives one a good quick-look at him and should encourage those who are so inclined , to check-out his films or books , if they haven't done so before .
rating:1 this is a coming-of-age film , that plays as bittersweet melodramatics . it's a pleasant little film , with its small aims hitting its target repeatedly , quietly reflecting the joys and sorrows the youngster must go through in order to grow up , and how the bland 1950s and its omens of the future in space travel , new pop-up toasters , and a tv in every house , influence the youngster's life . by being very easy to talk to , with no pretenses , he thereby develops a warm and natural relationship with the youngster and makes his summer experience a joyous one . the film is charming , it is sad , it is true-to-life , and never maudlin or sugary . it's a good nostalgia film for all those yearning to look back at their childhood , even if it be only vicariously through ingemar . i fell for the film without being swept off my feet by it . the message underlying ingemar's experience , is that life holds so much suffering in it , that one might as well get a few laughs out of it while one can . the scenes of the snow on the tv screen while all the neighbors are brought in to watch a movie , the radio broadcast of the swedish boxer ingemar johansson landing a lucky punch and knocking out the american champ floyd patterson , and the challenging games kids play to compete against each other , all brought back to me bittersweet memories of the 1950s .
rating:1 this is a true-to-life portrait of one of this century's most celebrated artists , as the film covers his work from the periods of the 1960s- through the- 1970s , as bacon's specialty in the macabre is examined , as is also his spectacle of what is horrific , but the film offers very little concrete arguments for him to be considered as a great artist ( we saw none of his paintings on display ; i realize that this was no fault of the director , since bacon's estate refused to grant permission for their use ) . that he is a great artist , is of course , a debatable subject ; but what is not subject to debate , is the brilliant performance by derek jacobi ( a virtuoso one ) and the fine supporting performance by his lover who is the foil for all his nasty wit , daniel craig ( george ) , as both exhibit a forcefulness and a subtly for their character that leaves no doubt that they have mastered their subject rather well , leaving no sharp stone unturned , so to speak . in the very first shot , bacon is diabolically smelling the pillow from an obvious lover who just left his flat , an image that reminded me so much of hannibal lecter in the silence of the lambs , and his extrasensory capacity for smell . that george and he are almost complete opposites , able to use each other for whatever it is worth , is part of the fascination of the bleak material covered , as the film becomes an exercise in excesses and debauchery , that is covered so wantoningly , with bacon referring to his relationship with george at one point , as the man who does odd jobs for him once in a while . that his precarious lifestyle often shines as brightly as his visual images , as his oeuvre of work is presented to us through these visions , rather than seeing it as on framed paintings , and this is stupendously done by a brilliant stroke of filmmaking , as the artist's soul was seen crawling out of the recesses of his warped but talented mind , as distorted lenses and mirrored images and shaded colorings and quick editing of the images , were all effectively used to enhance the eeriness of the artist's visions . i must confess , i never cared for bacon's art , though i was somewhat impressed with the raw power of his blood curling images and the deathlike objectivity he gives his work . but i was put off with his inability to reach farther back into the human soul and see what the whole being is like as the truly great artists such as a blake or durer can , who know both good and evil . to know one of the contraries is not enough , as it probably means that you can't even see that as clearly as you should , as in bacon's case , what evil is for him to see , is mostly felt as a raging flux inside , something jacobi captured on screen , that made this film a very special one , and saved it from the doldrums it could have been . it is rare that an actor can really sense the mood and spirit of an artist , because when he doesn't , it is to the detriment of the film , no matter how good the story is or who the artist is that is being portrayed . what comes to my mind is the risible performances of charlton heston as micheangelo and kirk douglas as van gogh , or more recently leonard di caprio trying to be convincing as an unknown artist in titanic . their lack of credibility as artists , were enough to make the films they were in seem phony . off hand , i can only think of derek jarman's caravaggio , to match this one in intensity and homosexuality , and integrity of performance . but whatever i think of bacon and his art work or the unwatchable moments this film had , and the pangs i got from his negative philosophy , and how the story was going down a cul-de-sac , i was nevertheless , still dazzled by a performance from derek jacobi , that left me breathless , and by a first time director , who is in every mannerism an artist and feels like an artist does , and was able to translate that inspiration onto the screen , which is no easy feat to do .
rating:1 i think i've seen this film before : it's called pulp fiction . but that aside , this is a very funny crime caper , involving double-crosses , kidnappings , and outrageous shootouts . it is stylized noir-- meaning noir is no more to be taken seriously as in the post-ww11 noir films . it is now used by many directors as a spoof of the genre , as it is here , by the first-time woman director , jennifer leitzes . the film relies on its characters to make things happen , as the story really is too slight to do the complete job , of making montana bigger than the small state of mind it is . it was scenes like this , coming in flashes , that kept the film alive . stanley tucci is a marvelous actor and is a joy to watch here . kyra sedgwick works well with tucci and significantly adds to the farcical nature of the film . philip seymour hoffman never gives a bad performance ; here he is the creepy turncoat , a part he can do in his sleep by now . but he does it well . the high level of acting raises this ordinary film in stature , but does not make it into anything more than a highly entertaining and derivative film .
rating:2 the tune emanating from the piano is a passionate one , coming forth on a desolate new zealand coastline , far removed from european culture , where a piano is seen as something peculiar to possess in such a backward area of the world . it is used symbolically to represent the works of civilization that can soothe the savage beast , if the beast is lonely and willing to listen to something he usually doesn't listen to . the underlying premise of the film is one of communication or lack of it in a world that can be cold , and of how easy it is to never find love in such a world . her voiceover says , " this is not the sound of my voice you are hearing ; it is the sound of my mind . " she these scenes are very powerful and surprisingly enough come across as being sensual , even if , the proposal as put-forth , at first , seemed to be an obvious power-play against a hapless victim . but campion knows how to draw out the passions from these scenes and make this unlikely romance between these opposites bloom . all that he knows , is that he just wants her physically , that he feels her inside his gut ; and , that he turns out to be a more sensitive person than at first thought possible , is precisely what gives impetus to this gothic romance . michael nyman's astonishing score , performed by holly hunter herself , expresses the explosive mood of this extraordinary visionary film . a film whose silence and music speaks for itself as an apt way of communicating . harvey keitel , masking a nyc accent by talking in some kind of maori pigeon tongue , is ably cast as the brooding lover who turns out to have a gentle soul , something this loner must have felt in his heart for a long time but now emerges inside him and gives the film a certain kind of raw power to it . anna paquin , in my opinion , is the best surprise in the film , the one with the most difficult role , and the one with the biggest part in the film . what makes it all the more amazing is that she is a mere child , asked to play a part on equal footing with all the accomplished actors she is surrounded by . her performance is the key one ; it is the one that propels the film to give it its needed air of desperation and to outline the passionate struggle between just surviving and living for love . she is strangely rejuvenated by the naturalism and lack of inhibitions found in this backward place and the passion she feels from baines , as it seeps into her repressed soul and transforms her . the film is brought slowly together by jane campion's masterful direction , whose understanding of the erotic desires of the characters is right on the mark , with the result being an original and haunting film , a story that grew more intensively disturbing for me the longer i thought about it . stuart dryburgh's camera captures the internal mood of the characters , as well as the monotonous beauty and the oppressive reality of the countryside . but the film misses the mark , at times , as the two main characters , stewart and baines , despite their fine performances , are nevertheless too one-dimensional to give the film more of an impact . it seems as if this is ada's story to tell and no one else's . this is a film , nevertheless , that will justifiably garner great interest because of her very trying performance .
rating:1 another feel good type foreign movie , ala the full monty , that seems to please the audience , drawing in enough crowds to turn a nifty profit for its independent producers , and is good enough so that the critics are very generous in their praises , playing down the film's bland politics . a quaint irish village , replete with ordinary type of folks as eccentrics , a clever little plot with a few surprises thrown in for down the road , a bunch of likable locals , colorful scenery , wonderful irish pipes heard in the background , and it all adds up to a gentle and charming little film , with no deep messages or symbolism attached to it . the only serious flaw in the film , is a contrived phone booth scene towards the end of the movie . that scene absolves the film from dealing with any bigger moral questions it might have raised , by getting rid of the fly in the ointment , the one character in the village that upset its tranquility . they gave the film a rich quality that goes beyond the story line and the moral implications of the scam that they perpetrated . and , of course , there is a wee bit of gossip in the air . the twist in the story is interesting , and if you have not seen the film and do not want to know this twist , please skip the following paragraph and go directly to my grade rating of the movie . now tell me , how many films have you seen lately that can get away with such a corny but happy ending and still be critically well-thought of ? review on 2/27/99
rating:0 a bleak indie film about a stolen identity . there's not much more to this visually stylish film than what meets the eye , as it relies on shock to tell its story of a prolonged vicious mugging . it falls into the category of being a pretentious art-house film , leaving a bitter taste in one's mouth as it stereotypes its characters and unintentionally further inflames the racial issues . but the story is so filled with violence and its nyc setting looks like hell , that it's hard to enjoy this film and to follow what the logic in the story is supposed to mean . the film works best as a visually challenging piece , as each shot looks like a photograph carefully telling the story unfolding . the film is stuck with a clumsy dialogue and an overuse of symbolism , as it ends with nothing more to tell after the shock and the violent situation it created except to beat it into the ground . it could only be commended for how appealing the film looks , as if it's a scrapbook of still photos put together to celebrate a mugging .
rating:1 a real-life chilling tale of matricide is put forth in a complex build-up of an obsessive and passionate relationship between two very imaginative adolescent girls , set in christchurch , new zealand , between 1953 and 1954 . the 33-year-old director , new zealander peter jackson ( braindead/dead alive ) , previously known for making gore films , has come up with a stunning melodramatic story , spoiled only by the director's excessive camera shots of the girls' fantasy world , which was more arty than enlightening . pauline is shy but bright , heavy-set and plain looking , from a working-class and uneducated family , with a scarred leg from a few operations due to weak bone structure ; while , juliet is pretty and slender , worldly , aggressively sure of herself , from an upper-class , well-educated family , but is suffering from tuberculosis . by tossing fantasy and reality together in such a haphazard manner , it creates a world of disturbing visions , one in which the film holds the viewer's interest throughout . it feels like we can't quite grasp what is on the girls' minds , even if we are privileged to hear pauline's troubling voiceover , explaining her diary notations , even if we are caught by the exilaratingly romantic moods of the girls and their imaginative games they play . the acting by winslet and lynskey is superb . the film is also visually stunning , but the moral of the story is never made clear and there is bit too much pretentious fantasy art thrown into the script .
rating:2 it plays out as a horror comedy low-budget b-film that is a parody of the hip art world and those who seek fame . its satire cuts deeper into this bohemian world than most other films . walter is discovered by leonard as a murderer , but since collectors are willing to pay big bucks for such detailed realistic work--he doesn't tell the cops . charles b . griffith provides the film with a witty script . character actor dick miller gives an impressionable performance , as does his romantic interest barboura morris . it's a bloody black comedy that is gruesomely funny and because of its unsophisticated way of probing into the underground art world--it exudes a radiant charm , a true cult film delight from the 1950s made for all eras .
rating:1 this tearjerker melodrama proved to be a big hit commercially for the popular silent star mary pickford . there is one scene where they both are together , and this was accomplished by the method of double-exposure . skip to the last paragraph if you don't want to know how the story is resolved . undoubtedly , the film is dated , but for its time and the excellent way the film was crafted , it succeeds as a popular soap opera type of vehicle . though , by having pickford , " america's sweetheart , " commit a murder , its ethics and reasons for doing so can certainly be questioned , though the happy ending satisfied the public . many film critics felt that this was the best role that pickford ever had . though the film was as heavy as goo , it was not without some passing interest for mainly historical reasons .
rating:0 it is a poorly done remake of " them ! " ,
rating:2 as is obviously intended , two can play that game is sure to hit big with the african american audience , but it should also be treasured as a great date movie for the moviegoing public at large . it's got the kind of friskiness that makes you exchange glances with the stranger seated next to you because both of you know how many things it gets right about relationships . with as many twists and turns as this romantic comedy takes , you're sure to have a good time . still , while the production contains all the correct ingredients , it uses them in the wrong recipe . it hits a humorous bulls-eye with plenty of cultural issues , but it lacks the very substance it's made of : true love . the film , written and directed by mark brown , makes a common hollywood mistake of confusing sexuality with true passion . not that this destroys the film ; in fact , for an r-rated sex comedy , this is very tame material . this production takes risks , but for a movie that concerns itself so much with romance , it just doesn't get any of that across convincingly . with frequent soliloquies , intrusive narration , and a central character that very much takes center stage , shante does not just narrate the film , she explains it . seldom do filmmakers gamble their success on such an unusual style , but the conceit gives the movie a sense of independence , attitude , and a unique , experimental flavor . fox's performance keeps energy alive , even when she knows her mouth is running a little too much . it's surprisingly entertaining . alas , the film does not really earn its ending . it doesn't persuasively prove the characters' sudden realizations . two can play that game is still light-hearted and fluffy . it exists solely to please the audience , but it also works as a social commentary . rating : * * * * |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------|
rating:2 there is no dialogue or narrator in the first version i saw , but in the later version ed mcmahon does the narration . these are some very weird freudian dream sequences . but the narrator poses the question , is it a dream of madness on a dark night -- or was it real ? this is a bizarre film , a precursor to welles' " touch of evil " and polansky's " repulsion . " if not made to be understandable , it is at least a very demanding depiction of someone demonically possessed by guilt .
rating:1 the league of gentlemen is a fine example of old-fashioned english humor : droll and civil . the film's strong suit is watching the precision planning that goes into the operation as it unfolds and how all these older blokes exhibit their odd personalties to mesh into a team-operation replete with proper military decorum . a very watchable caper movie , but with a decided british edge to it which might inhibit some american viewers from enjoying it as much . the lovable rogue characters give the film a spirited uplift , with hawkins , patrick , livesey , and attenborough being particularly good in their portrayals . what the film lacks is any kind of intensity , it's all comedy and manners .
rating:2 given the context of the material for this pulp thriller , it is surprising that this english speaking chabrol film , set in st . tropez , is as diverting and suspenseful as it is . credit must be given to an ingenious script , and acting kudos , especially for romy , jean , fran ? ois , and pierre , for making it possible for us to be fascinated with all the twists in the ever changing plot . chabrol will go on to explore many of the themes he has used before , to belittle the bourgeois lifestyle , to question why sex is the most important thing in a relationship , and how money is such a psychological part of one's mindset . mr . l ? gal is a pip , a pleasure to see on screen ; a character nonpareil , played to perfection , someone who , despite his small part , you will remember long after seeing the film . but if you think you got where the story is going now , you better get ready for a few more curve balls thrown your way , because chabrol is going to town with this thriller , twisting and turning at the movement of every julie sexy wiggle . the outcome is a satisfying one , though if you start to think of what occurred , of relationships changing every reel , of those dead , not being dead , you might have some doubts about the possibilities of pulling off all the switches . but by having the police using their power of deduction to amusingly follow the trail as closely and as delightfully as they can , it all adds punch to the pulp story , so even if you are aware that there are a few turn of events that might stretch the imagination a little too much , that maybe the story did get a little too cute , as there are too many places where you can cast doubt that the story would hold up to further scrutiny ; nevertheless , it is more fun to let the story pass as it is , and enjoy it for what it is , as jeff turns up alive , and the situation must get resolved again , as julie is now in a position to choose between the new louis , now able to service her properly , and the dashingly irresistible jeff . what an enjoyable film this is ! so much is thrown into the mix , if you don't like one twist in the story there is another to soon come , as the cold-hearted bitchy sexpot julie becomes more important to the men than the money or their state of well-being . chabrol even gives the justice system a well-deserved scolding , saying the reason for the vagaries in justice existing as it does for women , is because the law was created by men for men . the film begins in irony and ends in irony , even though everything about the characters involved has changed . even the police seem a little smarter for their effort .
rating:2 possibly the best british noir film ever made , a film adapted from the graham greene novel . the tourist bureau was so afraid that this gloomy look at brighton would scare off tourists , that the film opens with a " crawl " telling what a safe and jolly playground community brighton now is . in fact , he is more sympathetic to the killer in the film , no matter that he is a certifiable maniac . while he is too far gone , to do anything about what is right or wrong in the world . ida shoots back that people never change- " i haven't . " the last scene in the film is one of those memorable ones that just can't be easily forgotten . it has a raw power in it that a noir film commands when the dark side of human nature unfolds so suddenly onscreen , even if the scene was changed from the one in greene's novel . further saying , " i got his voice-i got proof of his love . " we have to hope and pray . when rose puts the record on , we have already heard what pinkie said and wait to see her reaction , but when she plays the record : " what you want me to say is i love you , " the record gets stuck and plays that over and over , until the final shot of the film is of the crucifix on the wall , with rose , seemingly , elated to have her love reaffirmed by such a positive proof . this cynical ending is perfect . the filmmakers thought it could be construed as possibly a happy ending for the filmgoers who thrive on a happy ending overcoming the general despair of the film . but the film was a failure at the box office . the only weakness in the film was the awkward pacing of the story and the over inflated role of hermione baddeley . it was a brassy portrayal that detracted from the noir mood of the film . richard attenborough's manic performace as a psychopathic , androgynous character , who had violent mood swings , was pulsatingly brilliant . his sadomasochistic relationship with the naive rose , coupled with dark shots of the seamy side of brighton , plus the expressionistic studio shots , gave the film a raw energy that makes it more powerful than the usual gangster film . if you have any kind of feel for noir films , this one is in the don't miss category .
rating:3 this is a noir film , one of the last one's shot that can truly emulate the spirit of the one's shot in the heyday of american noir , in the 40s and the 50s . melville wanted to make a french version of john huston's noir classic , the asphalt jungle ( 50 ) , as melville imbued in his film his strong beliefs about what a gangster picture should look like , making it original while covering all the subplots of that genre he could manage to fit into a film that runs for 150 minutes . the intense action scenes amidst the changing weather from rain to snow , plus the wooded area and the roadblocks the men must cross to get back to paris , gives the film an air of resolute desperation , that is intriguing to watch , as each camera shot is done by the hands of a master , reaching far into his characters and their surroundings . bunuel has very effectively used surreal shots like this in some of his films . the heist of the place vendome is excuted in silence for the 30- odd minutes it takes to pull off the job . for mattei , there is no such thing as police without informers . the film's conclusion is as violent as it has to be , since the mood was set from the film's onset to end this way . by this time , we know all the character's rather well , as we see who turns on the other , and how hypertense a policeman's job is , with not that much sanity separating his job from the criminal's . this is a top notch noir film . it has done an outstanding job in uncovering the themes of alienation and desperation , that drive men so hard that it is impossible for them to transcend their criminal nature .
rating:2 a road film about trying to reach somewhere . this human interest drama is one big metaphor about a strained father and daughter relationship . but she gets a flat tire and there's no spare . it's a film that avoids cliches for its answers , has plenty of energy , and an intelligent script to go along with the brilliant performances by both lena headey and stellan skarsgard . it is unfashionable to have a mind of your own . " " aberdeen " is thematically similar to mike figgis's " leaving las vegas , " except there the end of the journey was most important , here it is the journey itself that counts the most .
rating:1 ten days' wonder , the ( decade prodigieuse , la ) ( director : claude chabrol ; screenwriters : paul g ? gauff/paul gardner/eugene archer ; cinematographer : jean rabier ; cast : orson welles ( theo ) , anthony perkins ( charles ) , marlene jobert ( helene ) , michel piccoli ( professor ) , 1972-fr . ) chabrol continues to make original films in his own inimical style , some very successful , others not quite hitting the mark . this one is a theological mystery that is done in english , from an ellery queen novel . it is supported by a fine cast who set an eerie mood for a story that will involve adultery , madness , blackmail , deception , jealousy , theology , and murder . its results are mixed , being that it succeeds as something different from most thrillers but , it is rather chaotically done . at times it looks as if it were a b- movie . perkins' over-the-top portrayal of the manic charles is eye catching . the film begins to make sense if you view it from the unique theological spin it puts on the story . this unique film is both awkward and mesmerizing , and at all times tantalizing our sensiblities . it seems to want to question how deep our faith is in god , which is a recurring theme in many chabrol films . the answers are skewed , as chabrol is cynical enough to believe that the rich can get away with anything , including murder . but theo remains godlike , charming the public and buying them off with his wealth , making sure that they are only aware of his benevolent side . this is a film that might seem better the second and third time you view it than it does at first .
rating:1 there's something whimsical to be said about universal-international's most strained sci-fi film of the 1950s , it sunk to new lows to get to its subject matter . in this heavy-handed message film , the main theme depicts how intolerant people could be who hide behind their religious beliefs blindly and continue to keep others ignorant of the truth . the adventure was clumsily made and was too pedantic to be good cinema . the acting was stiff and the special effects were cheesy . but somehow there was fun to be had in all this under the earth nonsense .
rating:1 the film's leaden pace and pancake look and wooden acting , are all major detractions . at least , he was lively and looked as if he was into the part . i'm not a believer in miracles , nor am i disbeliever in miracles . i just don't think an orthodox religion , one that demands blind faith and obedience from its members can find the truth about such spiritual matters ( that's why i'm a non-believer in orthodox religions ) . for me , a miracle is when someone overcomes their karma and finds enlightenment , and is able to be filled with love , living without illusions , who can convey this feeling to others and make the world a little better place to live in . the only proof needed for such a miracle is in the freedom felt from within , by the person experiencing it . but for those who are believers in the orthodox , needing some proof that god can hear their prays , then this serious-minded film with its lack of kitsch , supposedly , can shed some light how a saint is chosen and how miracles are documented by the church . but , unfortunately , the story is not able to overcome the handicaps of its plodding story and therefore it fails to materialize as a credible one . in my opinion , the process of choosing a saint is just as much political as religious , and the director waffled in which direction to go . in the end , she chose to cop-out , with one of those slick , unsatisfactory modern endings , which is contrary to the underpinnings of this very european-styled film . it results in a draw between the rivals within the church structure , and who feels satisified walking away from an event and not having a winner ! there is no rational explanation for this occurrence . this will be submitted to the church's upper echelons . the priest discovers he has a carnal interest in roxanna , which he is able to resolve , but it is done in such a banal way , with no chemistry between the two to justify their relationship , or does their relationship result in finding anything significant to say about a priest thinking like a man . is this too a miracle ? it was difficult to believe in the story or be absorbed in it , as the acting was stilted and the process of choosing a saint did not enlighten me as to what really happens in the church back rooms . i found it impossible to believe anything father frank found about helen would , necessarily , make her a saint , except for political reasons to satisfy the faithful . i don't know what i learned from this film , or what the film tried to deliver as a message . but i do know that the story failed to keep me from yawning , as i preferred the much more flawed recent miracle film , stigmata , to this one , even though this film had no kitsch like the other one did , but it also had very little movement and took few risks in the sober-minded way its story was told . so much for the intelligent telling of a story , if the story is not convincing . there would have to be a fourth miracle to get me to believe in this flick .
rating:1 this is the original film adaptation of the graham greene semi-autobiography . the older b&w version puts less stress on the lust and more on the inner conflict the two lovers are having . it's a more reserved telling of the story , probably due to the conservative time it was filmed than anything else . this version actually leaves a greater impact on the viewer of the momentous tragedy of the self-imposed restrictions religion has placed on the relationship for her . the story never seems illogical , as does the tacky ending to the later version , which tried to get too fancy in its approach to this melodramatic love story . there was no reason to make a remake , and especially so , since the newer version doesn't add anything new to the mix that the older version didn't already have . what evolves through greene's telling of the inner spiritual battle worked out through the characters , is that what is impossible becomes what is religious and man's worldliness is seen as something that is not completely satisfying to him but is something he thinks he needs to satisfy because he doesn't believe in an afterlife . that she loves him so much , that to just have him live will be worth it . the priest responds , " you made a vow to someone you didn't believe in -- you have the free will to break it . " but you have also taken the first step toward god , that you could continue with , if you so choose . dmytryk has made an intelligent and cogent version of a tough novel to film , and made it into an impressionable film . the best performances in the film came from the two actors who seemed to be effortlessly acting , john mills , as the detective interested more in the craft of his job than the ethics , though always aware of the moral implications of what he is doing . his pleasurable performance stole the film . in many respects , i found this the more interesting version . what the other version had , was more explicit sex scenes and a better actor playing bendrix .
rating:1 alan ( trouble in mind , choose me , moderns ) rudolph's off-beat film has the look and feel of bad melodrama , using over-exaggerated action sequences to spin a convoluted yarn ( maybe a parody ) about twins , born to a ballerina who had an affair with a european aristocrat and is forced into giving them up for adoption when he wants no part of her . the title of the film , as defined , will refer to the equality of the light and dark sides during an equinox . she weaves this ambiguous tale or spoof , or whatever it is , together . as all the quirky characters will somehow fit into the story and by the end of the film , i guess , there is supposed to be some hidden message as henry stands alone , looking down at the tremendous depths of the grand canyon . there was one stupid line she said to him that made me laugh primarily because it was so stupid , " you're not going to catch nothing from me but your breath . " in fact , the only enjoyment i derived from all the banal dialogue and its embarrassing story ( if it wasn't a parody , then it's a horrible script , and if it is a parody , it doesn't work , the story is too ambiguous ) was the b- movie one-liners that kept coming throughout the film . since that's the only thing i liked about this film , i'll drop a few of them on you : freddy to another gangster , " never miss a good chance to shut up . " one gangster talking to another , " i was so popular in high school , everybody hated me . " i'll mention two quotes mr . petosa gives us from his vaudeville shtick he seemed to be doing for his characterization , " if money didn't grow on trees , how come banks have so many branches ? " and " chaste makes waste . " henry tritely says , " my whole life seems to be taking place without me in it . " beverly to henry , which is the most pertinent line in the film , banal as it is , " your whole life is searching for one thing , and all that other stuff just fades away . " i don't know what the story is supposed to mean ; maybe its just a search-for-identity kind of film ; maybe its an updated fairytale about " the prince and the pauper , " as one critic suggests . but i found it to be muddled , unfunny , and the acting is so lame , especially matthew modine's overacting , that it is almost unbearable to watch . but i got a kick out of those stupid one-liners from all the zanies trying so hard to be to be zany , and there was something intangible about the film that made you keep watching it , hoping there was something there that you missed seeing . so , at least , it's an original film ; a passable one , at that , with a lot of possibility to it ; and , it is done in the bizarre auteur style this filmmaker likes to operate in .
rating:3 in any case , he has accomplished a work of exquisite visual craftsmanship , another fitting feather in the cap for one of the most original innovators in cinema today . his sharp photographic images intermingled with some grainy shots and his never static camera angles ( reminiscent of ones used in his other films ) and his use of different shades of light to transpose his visions from a dream world to reality , give the film a magical look , capturing and sweeping us into its grand design . it is a film that unfolds like a dream , whereby it is to be viewed with eyes wide shut . the film's opening immediately engages us in its sexuality : the tall , curvaceous lady peeling off her black dress with her back to us , is nicole kidman , and the next shot fades to darkness , it is as if the curtain was pulled down on a sex show and we are told that now that we have seen her lovely ass , the rest is up to our imagination . the show is over ; we can make of it what we want . the intricate telling of their relationship involves the dreams they have , a ceremonial orgy he attends , nudity-including his viewing and kissing of a corpse for a long few moments , a jealous marital relationship to tweak our morbid curiosity , and an obtuse ending that should satisfy those who can't accept tidy endings in their films . make no mistake about it , sex is their problem . kubrick , bless his courage , will stick to this obsessive theme , not giving an inch of leeway for any other reason , from the alpha to the omega of the film . and to his credit , it is that intensity that gives the story fuel to propel itself and work its way into the understanding we have of the chemistry and dynamics in the relationship the two have . a picture perfect relationship that is shown to be already not perfect after the first five minutes of the film . that cruise is nearly perfect for the part ( the only slight negative thing about his performance was that his constant cell phone action reminded me too much of the jerry maguire character ) , as he displays a wide range of emotions and ability , to be a turd and then come back and be human again , is the kind of acting he hasn't been required to do so far in his career , but with the wonderful relationship he developed with stanley , he is able to understand who he is and be able to be convincing as a young doctor for the rich and as a dye-in-the-wool materialist , committed to being a doctor and intelligent enough to see changes in his life as necessities . the entire cast is superb . the this scene is sheer brilliance , one of the best kubrick has ever done , it is a scene that is so humanly emotional , something that his naysayers said he could never do ; the acting catches all the nuances of a real and fictious relationship , something that an inexperienced acting duo could not have done so effortlessly and made it seem so impactful . what made the streets particularly foreboding was the skillful manipulation of lights to reflect either a dream or reality world he was in , with the penetrating brightness of the neon emanating from the clubs and storefronts making them look like sites from hell . the slide down a decadent path for the couple ends mirthfully , but on a seemingly depersonalized note , as alice's answer to everything is a resounding let's f * * * . this film has all the earmarks of a masterpiece despite its let down in certain spots : is the cruise character worth all the fuss over saving ? is kubrick's overtly homosexual characterization of a desk clerk gratuitous or necessary to show that cruise attracts both men and women to him ? it is probably a film that has to be seen a few times before its characterizations fully sink in and the power of its story can be fully appreciated . the whole societal process of how dehumanized we have all become is opened up for further speculation , as sex our most intimate response to love is dehumanized and played out in the need for an orgy . this two day whirlwind the couple has might be the beginning of who knows what , and that is scary , as most people want some reassurances about their future . a thinking man's work of art has evolved , and a very splendid film to end the century on , as well as to end the career of one of our most distinguished directors . in this film's case , all the hype the film got did not work against it .
rating:1 these are not pleasant characters , they are sad and funny ; they are pathetic and desperate , but they are definetly not cute or pleasant , and cannot even remotely be thought of as nice people . therefore this romp , down this tawdry road , fits the acting style of james woods to a tee , it seems as if he was born to play these over-the-top , quirky , offbeat roles . and since , it shouldn't be that difficult to figure out , that this film is glued to its brutally violent story line , directed by a director who relishes sleaze , like some have pangs for twinkies , you should have a pretty good idea where this road movie is going to take you ( clark's previous movie was in the same gritty cinema verite style , kids ) . this is the 90s version of that infamous couple's story , just needing a bit more violence and some drugs to tell its tale . the kid very intelligently asks , why me ? what comes next is a learning experience for the young couple , as the kids are treated as if they were full blown junkie grown-ups by their new surrogate parents , treated to champagne and new clothes and lots of dope , but the initial thrill of being a hood begins to change for these druggies , who basically would be content just to make love and sniff some drugs , but are now heavily involved on a trip that is too much for them to really handle . their humor comes in small charges of underlying truths , as they tag along mainly for the ride into big time crime , still too naive to comprehend their total situation . the problem with the film , despite its authentically-acted characterization , is what can you make out of it that makes sense . since the film can't possibly give us much to say about bobbie other than conveying he is the only one of the four characters who might have a chance of surviving and living to be sixty , we can only hope that this kid with the angelic face , can somehow make it on his own . i recently saw james woods on the charlie rose pbs show , where he talked about his love for this film and belief in it , praising its independently directed efforts and sort of castigating the movie industry ( whenever i hear the term " movie industry " , i can only think in terms of business not art ) for not promoting this film and others like it that are honest efforts , refusing to make formula type of commercial films . i can only concur with him , just wishing that an independent film doesn't necessarily have to be youth orientated or about drugs or violence or sex to sell itself . there are so many other themes out there that have not been so thoroughly explored as these themes have been , and therefore for me to really get on the bandwagon of a film such as this , i just want to see something different already . i am inundated up to my tired eyeballs watching films with the same themes , differing only in the nuances and styles of their story , so that their originality comes intermeshed with one another , causing me to sometimes mistake one film for another . and i think , that is the most critical thing that i can say about this often funny , mostly bleak , derivative film , that was credibly but not compellingly acted , in reality , leaving no visual impact on me , it was too much like feeding on junk food and then going home and realizing that you were not eating a healthy meal and , besides , the enjoyment of it wasn't that great to begin with .
rating:2 a good story is infused with too much symbolic pretentiousness , yet the overall effect is absorbing . the film won an academy award for best screenplay and director for john huston , while his father walter huston won for best supporting actor . it was nominated for best film , but lost to hamlet . this black and white film is very well acted , especially by bogie and walter huston , but is not as gripping and intriguing as john huston's masterpiece -- " the maltese falcon . "
rating:2 it turns out that she didn't murder anyone , it was all the theater group's idea of testing out her skills as an actress in this real-life audition to see if she would get the part . it makes for a rousing climax , as karlson is good at doing the revenge thing in a crisp and rugged way . it's an absorbing film that holds your interest as it explores the life of people in the ring . it also covers the usual criminal types in a typical noirish way . it throws enough light and ideas around to make this a compelling film , better than your average film noir . its stylized violence and passion from the characters were both unreal and real , as the desperate characters grappled with the truth of their lives .
rating:1 this stuff is all hush-hush . gee ! by this time the major and barbara show a strong affection for each other , and a little romance is blooming without even a kiss or holding of hands taking place , though there is one scene where she comes out of the shower with just a towel on and you know that got the major's attention . now this romance could be taken for a serious one . it seems that the major is the only one on the base who does any work . so , you see , the major is a very busy man . it now becomes obvious that the professor is involved in this mystery , and the fun part of the film begins , or some might think the film really goes out of whack from here on . but things are not that simple , the atomic plant malfunctions and can't be shut down , and to my delight , the creatures become visible because of the increase in atomic power in the nuclear plant . what's viewed on screen are brains with a spinal cord attacking everybody they see , killing all the people manning the nuclear plant . there are great special effects , using stop-motion animation to show the brains moving around ! as entertainment value , this film should hit the right spot : it's a screamer . as anything greater , the story made little sense . this is just another mutant b- flick that is missing most of its brain .
rating:3 it is visually the best of such films made , a classic study in heroism and in military planning , that stays with the men in battle as they fight for survival and doesn't go off into the politics of why they are there . the aim will be to hold the outside perimeter at all times and reinforce any side that is being attacked . the battle scenes were memorable , the acting was first-class , the director correctly offers no explanation for the why of the battle as the action itself seems to explain the absurdity of their situation . the professional soldiers say , " we fight because we are here , there is no one else who will fight for us . " the film offers no explanation about the racial nature of the conflict , as it is played mostly as a story of a courage on both sides . the film does not display a racist attitude . burton announces that there have been 1 , 344 such medal given out overall . chad and bromhead worked well together despite their class differences , with chad showing a natural ability to think fast and act without indecision . there is a certain fascination about this movie that makes it a moving experience , especially in watching the zulus perform under endfield's direction . zulu is presented in such a tough-minded and matter-of-fact way , that it is hard to argue against the way it was filmed . it was also an interesting bit of casting by the co-producers endfield and baker , of having the cockney caine play a stuffy upper class englishman . but it worked ; caine was just splendid , it is still one of his finest hours in film .
rating:0 this b-film , directed by samuel fuller , is one that failed to work . the setup seemed so wooden , while the bourgeois villains seemed more like cartoon figures than real people . even the hero and the heroine failed to be convincing and looked more like imitations picked off the reels of other such b-films . they will rob the three counselors they despise -- mussolini , mr . desterne , and tartuffe -- and humiliate them in the same way they have been by them . this one should only be appreciated by sam fuller fans .
rating:2 what gets into the headlines determines how most of us view the world . emira nusevic plays herself , with the realistic sense of danger emanating from one who actually lived through this story . since the war is precipitated at this point in history by the serbs , the film has little choice but to point out that the serbs are mainly responsible for what is happening now . what is so forcefully happening in sarajevo , even though it is on the news everyday , has not caught the american people's attention as much as you might think it would . the this film offers an honest portrait of the media in action , as it also depicts a public that is more interested in being entertained than being informed . it seems as if the public could care less about what is happening there . so it shouldn't be all that surprising that the public also showed its indifference at the box-office to this heartfelt film .
rating:0 this is a movie made for those who enjoy bad films . it's an exploitation teen movie with no redeeming social or entertainment value . it also fails to deliver any messages , to raise social consciousness , or to succeed as an artistic film . it's just a badly scripted and acted film , that by being so terrible might provide a few chuckles for the discrete viewer who likes looking through trash . the film ends sugarcoated with false piety and some idiotic questions are asked about the kids ; such as , where will the kids go ? the only question i had , was why make a film like this ? this film was as real as a snowball in hell .
rating:1 warning : spoiler in the next paragraph . the film ends with a long kiss between the japanese-american detective and the white artist , making a loud statement that it's fine that the heroine prefers someone of a different race . it's a satisfactory fuller work , that is lurid while also reflective of the racial divide in the country . in his gritty way , fuller hammers home the point of the need for racial tolerance and that there's urban alienation out there to deal with . the problem with the film , is that the mystery story was never developed and seems included as just an afterthought .
rating:2 but until then , it just seemed like a very entertaining pop culture film , whose satire comes about in comic-strip form , as it tweaks the side of sensibility in favor of perversity . but then again , it is quite possible that the film is so polemic and so full of contempt for society , that its theme revolves around the scientists surviving in a wasteland anyway they can ( maybe a referral to t . s . if that is the case and i suspect it is , then this film becomes a more sublime work than i thought at first , chewing off more than what can be seen . its ideas do not completely vanish in flames by the film's end but just smolder , even though the film never veers from being nihilistic . the dutch-born paul verhoeven ( starship troopers/total recall/showgirls/basic instinct ) , a director i never thought much of before as being subtle , thoroughly hating his fascistic parody , starship troopers , and being only mildly accepting of his other sleazy films , directed this thriller with an eye to his staple signature as an auteur -- of misanthropy and lurid erotic behavior combined with mindbending special-effects . the special effects are truly stunning , as we watch the gorilla become invisible , as her body when it changes looks like one of those see-through bodies in an anatomy textbook . i might not have had much use for the creepy sebastian , but i understood his human defects : his selfish motivations and his sexual curiosity , as annoying as those faults may be , at least it is something that was explored by the director in his invisible man theme , something other filmmakers of invisible men films haven't done , giving fire to the role kevin bacon so ably played . i also found elisabeth shue to be alluring , offering beauty and vulnerability , a sense of feminine instinctiveness , intelligence and of endeavor , in a film that caught an hypnotic sense of cynicism and ran with it . the remaining cast members looked as if they would be part of a research team and filled the film with the proper atmosphere needed . this is not a slasher film per se but it could be , it had all the gore required for a movie appealing to teens looking for a film with a quick mindless thrill . i found it to be most like a pop culture treat ala hollywood , adding its own brand of vitriolic delights to the sci-fi/horror genre , which has spawned many films with much the same tendencies , such as " aliens " and " the fly ( 86 ) , " but none with the same erotic tendencies and magnificent special effects . this one's a visual delight , much more intense and sleazier than the other recent similar films of this type , but one that can only push the pop culture button so far , because what does it all mean seems to be lost in the hollowness of the story itself .
rating:3 it was one of the early yiddish talkies to date and one of the most prestigious . schwartz was celebrated as being the 'olivier of the yiddish stage . 'he is one of the world's greatest actors ( he was tevye in fiddler on the roof ) but he is not as recognizable a name as he should be . this comedy/romance that turns dramatic , should give you a good idea of how great an actor he is . though he is not a religious man , he respects the traditions , as the film makes many biblical allusions in telling its story .
rating:0 there's slim pickings in this shamelessly contrived melodrama built around a wal-mart setting . all the contrived sitcom scenes just never click . it's a film about a vulnerable , low-class , and stupid woman , but a woman who is good-hearted . the result is a predictably boring film which neatly ties up all the loose ends by its conclusion , whose heart lies where the schmaltz is . the film appears to be one big advertisement for the giant department store and its generosity to its trailer park clientele . novalee will almost blow her chance of real love , by thinking she's not smart enough for forney . but , wouldn't you know it , there's a happy ending , as novalee finally makes a smart decision and marries forney . this is a film that got itself stuck inside wal-mart and could never get out of aisle 5 . director williams , he once directed the roseanne tv show , uses the material adapted from billie letts' best-selling novel to keep everything as dumb as he can .
rating:1 he met the director chris smith when he took a course of his in filmmaking at the university of wisconsin , and smith found that mark's story might be a compelling one , showing how by sheer determination someone can make a film and get it distributed . at the sundance film festival , an appreciative audience found this film hilarious and the festival responded by awarding it the grand jury prize . the film is more interesting when viewed from the angle of mark's personal life and where he's currently at than from him making an ed wood jr . classic film . that he is not always a likable person is also shown , as he uses people and is a bull-shit artist . it all amounts to a home movie more on the level of a precocious teenager than the work of a professional . mark pronounces it with a long 'o' because he doesn't want it to rhyme with oven . but his good will shines through , as every sentence he tries to utter results in a pause and a frivolous giggle . uncle bill is a riot in his lifeless responses to anything mark asks him , wryly amused at how serious mark is over a film he could care less about . mark is indomitable in his pursuit of his dream and chris smith has done a fine job of editing the film and nailing down his subject as accurately as he could , so that the dark side is balanced with the rosy picture mark paints for himself . all this film did was make him a laughing stock instead of the audience discovering someone with a talent for comedy . i have no desire to see coven , watching it being made was enough for me . mark's first words in the film are , " i was a failure . " he goes on to say , " he was a talented kid with a bright future , " and he wound up at 30 , as mark , with a beer in his hand , thinking about the great american script and the great american movie . " what more can one say !
rating:1 the gauche wardrobe and fancy haircuts are part of the flashy drug scene and the film's attempt to capture the real look of the druggie scene . his hedonistic journey through the marijuana years of the 1960s and 1970s and the disco cocaine years of the 1980s and 1990s , is a sad reminder of the way the pop culture scene had its darker side . the highs from " blow " come mostly from the colorful fashion show it parades before us and depp's brilliantly nuanced performance , as he shows off his inscrutability and his swagger , where he challenges us to be sympathetic to him even if he's a lowlife drug dealer and an uninteresting character , whose selfish dream is all about himself accumulating money and material happiness . there was not much else to get off on , as " blow " didn't have the script or the kind of direction needed to blow one away . the movie plays it real safe , as the only users the audience sees are the flashy hollywood types that no one cares about . " blow " suffered because it was too simplistic in its storytelling , in its nonjudgmental stance on drugs , and in shamelessly pulling the audience to the side of the nice guy drug dealer , george jung . it doesn't even have the will of another recent drug trafficking film , " traffic , " to even spend a moment worrying about the consequences of hard drugs . but the biggest bust about " blow , " is that it's just not a good film to get off on . if cocaine was not the subject matter , this film would be boring ( and it probably wouldn't have been made ) . george failed to be a worthwhile character for us to care about him . this film is just another blip in a long line of unimportant drug related films . really . . . the best thing that could be said about the film , is that it doesn't preach to us .
rating:2 what works very well for coppola , is the over-all mood he captures of how the inner city kids react to their identity crises . we see how they are turned off by school and how they don't have proper parental guidance ; it is also pointed out that if these kids had the proper role models things might be a lot different for them . " the motorcycle kid " is an existential hero , saying very little ; but if you get into his rap , he is more likely to be a hero found in a camus story than in a teen film . that makes his characterization seem controversial and arbitrary here . he has a swagger to him and a way about him that makes him larger than life , even mythic . everything he does ends in violence or in an incomprehensible situation . there was not really anything new revealed about this sort of character that hasn't been seen in other teen films ; but , the film does have the gritty feel of reality to it and intelligence in how the story was presented . i'm on the side of those who liked this emotionally wrought , stylized film , adapted from a novel by s . e . hinton , warts and all . it brought a higher quality to this teen genre film than usually seen in such films , even if , i doubt if it would reach the troubled kids the film was about , who in all probability , would not choose to see such an arresting film . to the film's credit , it was not a glossy look at the kids : it had the good sense to stay true to its theme without just blaming society for the problems presented .
rating:0 celebrity is like an amalgam of old woody allen materials , which has always given him an opening to concentrate on being witty and ignoring such filmmaking details as editing and plot . this fluff film ( no pretense at ingmar bergman depths here ) could have been funny but it isn't , except in brief spots . as far as being insightful about the " horses arses " who are into being celebrities without any other accomplishments to their credit , there's not really too much to be said that could be profound about that subject matter , it is obvious how shallow a fate just being a celebrity is . woody makes a stronger statement in the film's subplot that deals with love , as he believes that meeting the right mate is mostly a matter of luck . here kenneth branagh is not woody allen , but he plays woody and it doesn't work out that well . he's just not funny , all he's got down pat are woody's voice inflections and neurotic gestures . it's as if he is a robot who looks the part but can't really be the part because he is isn't humanly programed that way . if woody played that scene , it most probably would have been funny , but with branaugh , it seemed pathetically flat and unfunny . donald trump is buying st . patrick's cathedral and tearing-it-down for a skyscraper . celebrities give trite comments to banal questions , such as , " what do you think of the rain ? " " it's really something ! " the beautifully shot b/w film ends as it begins , as a plane passes overhead with the skywriting word " help ! " this was a film that had no idea how to put this story together , it seemed so lifeless and flat , indeed , in need of help . for starters , none of the main characters were cast right , and especially branaugh : there's no way , no matter how exact his mimicry of woody is , that he can be thought of as a neurotic , nebbish , nyc jew . what was needed was some originality and some energy into making the characters appear absurdly funny and not carbon copy imitations of how celebrities are . the few jokes in the film were far and few between , and could not overcome the tired feeling emanating from the rambling story . woody is slipping , his last few films have been heading on a steady downward path .
rating:0 the screenplay was written by dorothy azner , who made it into a statement film about women being abused in a male-dominated society . the sympathetic jury comes in with a not guilty verdict . the film itself was unconvincing and too banal to strike a chord with me . it therefore doesn't surprise me , that , perhaps , gabrielle wasn't as nice a person as portrayed in the film . this film is worth a look only for historical reasons , to see how melodrama was done before there were talkies .
rating:1 it also puts him in a depressed mood , as he says he would rather die than live and not play his music . the remainder of the film flounders in long stretches of unbelievable fantasy , some soothing touches of originality here and there , oodles of romantic schmaltz , and a story that can't hold up to intelligent scrutiny . but , then again , if you bought into the film's gimmicky filmmaking style and didn't think it was a smarty-arty pretentious ploy like i did , then maybe you can have a better feel for how the story transpired than i did . pabst's silent masterpiece . catherine gets a chance at the dinner table to tell izzy , that she gave up acting because i didn't want to be invented by anyone , anymore . but the funniest conversation at the dinner table is reserved for one between izzy and phil , as phil wants izzy's opinion on what he would do if he found a piece of turd on an airplane toilet seat cover after an attractive lady left the toilet , like he did on a recent flight . you see , it was a contrivance for the script . the filmmaker must have thought it would work out better for the story if he gets jumped in nyc rather than in dublin . all we get to know about the mystery of the stone is from dr . van horn , as we hear him prattle on about how precious the stone is , and if in the right hands , such as his , how much good it can do . there will be no payoff regarding knowing about this mystery , which is a major problem with the film . there is so much wrong with this film , that even when things are going well for it and it seems like there's some suspense and an intriguing bit of artiness thrown into the script , inevitably it is ruined by a story that just doesn't make sense , and even if it did make sense to those who are more tolerant of the film than i was , it still doesn't excuse the filmmaker from trying to be too clever and disguising his story as something it isn't . to be more precise in my critique , would be to give away the film's flimsy payoff , which would not be fair to those who haven't seen lulu yet . i just got the feeling auster didn't know too much more about this mystery than the viewer did , and because of that the film is lacking substance . i also thought keitel was too old to play the love interest of a much younger sorvino , as their romance , the keystone of the film , failed to be inspiring , as it should have been for the film to have had any chance to be effective .
rating:2 the iverson ranch at chatsworth , a movie site rented out to all studios , was dressed up and used for the technicolor production of rko's rancho notorious , giving the film its artificial look . nevertheless , lang's western overcame that obstacle and today is considered as one of the strongest and the most unusual westerns of its kind , a film that could not be dragged down by the bickering between lang and dietrich during the filming , or by the low budget ordered by howard hughes which kept most of the work in the studio , or by hughes' taking lloyd gough's name off the credits because he failed to testify in the huac's hollywood witchhunt . it was the first westerns to make use of a folk ballad , which was played at various times during the film , called chuck-a-luck , to bolster its theme of " hate , murder , and revenge . " this was a ludicrous concept to believe , as if one expected the bandits to be honest with her and give her the exact amount to stay , but it is fair to say , that reality was not one of the film's strong points . it's lang's best and last western , one that covers again the themes he successfully used in his noir films , and one that makes good use of his expressionistic style of filmmaking . but aside from looking old , marlene proved she was up to the part acting-wise , giving a mannered and brilliant performance , making this western a legendary one . it has a certain electricity about it that makes it special , even if does seem a bit corny at times .
rating:3 this film was made in mainland china and is one of the great and courageous films of the 1990s . it has been banned in china for its political content , and the director has not had another film of his released overseas . tietou tries to make sense out of what happens to his ordinary family , but he just can't seem to fully comprehend why so much misfortune occurred . " the blue kite " is the most acrimonious indictment in a film of chairman mao's regime , that i can recall . the picture best demonstrates how the politics and history of the revolutionary times affect the lives of real people . this provocative film is not a flattering look at the myopic political situation in modern china . it tells of simple truths , emphasizing family life , while it is brilliantly crafted in a most moving way . times are difficult , there is not enough food , but everyone seems happy and there is a sense of strong family ties and a strong comradeship among neighbors . there is also an air of innocence and fun that seems to be contagious . the point of the story is that the bonds between mother and child remain strong , no matter what . this film accurately captured the mentality of those who go along with such acts , those who are brainwashed into always thinking they are right and ignoring all the harm they do to people that might have different opinions than they do , people who just want to live peacefully and have decent lives . it is surprising that this film got out of the repressive clutches of china . it clearly showed the horrors of the human drama inflicted on its subjects , the tremendous portrayal of motherhood by lu liping , and the oppression emanating from the chinese dictatorship . this lyrical film offers an eye-opening experience about recent events there , and probably the only people it can't penetrate , are the maoist international movement , a group that is in self-denial about how tyrannical china is .
rating:1 this chilling tale left a lot to be desired and despite having an intelligence and originality to it , it degenerated into a jejune work , more of a display of style over substance . i felt cheated by its wearisome ploy of not decifering what was a dream and what was reality , feeling more like i was being manipulated than i was at being treated to something special . in a positive vein , this low-budget film kept moving at a swift pace and the story was conceivable to a point . the film managed to hold my interest until about the halfway point , when too much of the same interplay between dreams and reality was never made clear , so much so that i stopped suspending disbelief , which is tantamount to pulling the life support on one of these flicks and rendering it brain dead . the slogan for the product would be : the new you from eunice . it is further explained to martin , that these are numbers we do not want to get into anyone else's hands . the proposition is , that we get you a meeting with him and you get to do brain surgery on him , and if you can manipulate his thought process so we get the three numbers we need , fine . but if he should go brain dead , that's fine too . as loopy as the story is from here , it is the most sense it will make , because everything gets more confusing from here on , after martin visits the harmless but paranoic halsey in lakeside . there are also dreams within the dreams , adding more confusion , until the film ends on a dull conventional note , after all the expections of something radical being promised . the film didn't do much for me , as it was not worth putting in all the effort to watch it , as the payoff seemed too little . but the dream sequences were scary and the film had an intelligent approach to its horror rather than the usual exploitive one . . . if only it made more sense ! pullman seemed believable as someone losing sense of reality , while paxton was robotic in his role , playing it without feeling . all the other performances were as forgettable as the film .
rating:1 this is an authentic " dogma 95 " film , as before the film opens , that assurance comes with a signed guaranteed shown on the screen that it was made according to the rules stipulated by the danish directors who founded this school of sparse filmmaking -- lars von trier and thomas vinterberg . the hand-held camera was obvious throughout the film as were the film's lack of special effects , supposedly giving the viewer a chance to discover on their own any beauty worth finding in the film , rather than to be hit over the head with it . like all dogmas , they eventually wear out whatever usefulness they might have had in the first place . soren kragh-jacobsen's " mifune " is dogma's third approved project , after vinterberg's " celebration " and von trier's " idiots . " it is the weakest of the three , but still , it has some punch in a conventional way due to the film's technical clarity . it is a playfully weird telling of a familiar romantic comedy situation , much like a hollywood formula film . it has a lot of dead spots where it tried comedy and a lot of predictability as far as its romantic situation , but it also had a certain intrinsic beauty about it that kept it afloat and made it seem better than its story was . it is , nevertheless , a surprisingly conventional work , which makes me wonder about all the fuss this dogma 95 group go through to give the impression that they are radical filmmakers . a rather trite choice of subject matter for a group that i would have thought to be more politically motivated . what worked well in this film , was that the actors had personality that flashed on the screen , and that there were some breathtaking nature shots of the golden sun going down and of the rich colors of the danish backwater fields . this film doesn't go against that observation . now i would have bet anyone in the theater and have given them 10-1 odds , that was the last of the marriage , that's how obvious this plot was . her smile is the pure one , while claire also smiles , but her's is a selfish one . this dogma 95 film left me unmoved , though its story was pleasant and well-crafted . it just felt too much like an art-house film designed to please its audience rather than to be provocative .
rating:3 this extra-ordinary film offers a long hard look at its subject matter , as the camera is held steadfast , not moving for insatiably long periods of time , picking up all the appropriate nuances it needs to with deliberate dispassion , as it looks at an oregon lumber mill , whose owner ( tom blair ) is faced with unsettling economic news about the business he has built-up and worked at for his 50- odd years of life . by seeing who this man is , we get to see how he adjusts to his carefully scripted life , the fly-fishing he loves to do for the sport of it , his easy and almost gentile manners , and his very definite american persona , as he is forced out of economic necessity to deal with the japanese businessmen he inherently despises , and we get a picture of a rather complicated individual , who has difficulty in communicating with himself and others , so the closer we get to him , the more we sense that there are a lot of things about him that remain unanswered . this scene could also be deemed as an attack on america's soul , exposing it to questions about truth and character , principles that are put under the microscope , as the story builds to its very tragic outcome . this is one of jost's deepest and most penetrating films , it could even be argued that he has made a classical film , as it forcefully and subtly tells an american story , replete with unanswered questions about family life that are haunting , that give the film a certain power that makes you think for a long time afterwards what is it about this country that is so raw and violent in nature , that becomes a part of the people's own nature . one of the scenes that i found most memorable , was when the camera panned the diner where tom was dining with some co-workers and all we could hear , at first , was the muffled conversations of the patrons , as the camera meticulously panned the diner , until the atmosphere of the place was fully absorbed and we returned to tom and his conversation , which became clearer , as this scene played out a daily experience most americans have had but has rarely been captured so exactly on film . this time consuming shot , is not attempted by commercial filmmakers who live in fear of losing their audience in a long non-action shot . this is one of jost's strong points , his willingness to explore territory others fear to go . jost's film can be justifiably criticized for a few lapses in the story line it didn't clarify more precisely , but more importantly , it should be praised for the poetry it brings to its story when telling about a malaise in the american culture that is difficult to come to grips with , as the american landscape is perceived as so beautiful a sight to behold and the country as so wealthy a place when compared with the rest of the world , as it asks . . . but , what does this mean if americans are not a happy people ?
rating:1 cmdr . a well-crafted submarine psychological thriller , from a novel by richard sale . to barney's dismay , the torpedoes hit the freighter sinking it . no one will question barney doyle's patriotism . to the film's credits , ford's performance is well-mannered and credible . the action scenes of the eventual show-down between the rivals , makes for exciting cinema . it was hard to believe that everyone who wore a navy uniform could be that perfect . thereby a certain banality crept in to this otherwise compelling presentation . as for submarine type action films , this one as for human drama far outweighs the recently released u-571 , and also for authenticity , acting , and suspense . the only thing the newer version has over this submarine flick , is that it makes good use of how far the technology has come , as its digital special effects take full-advantage of that .
rating:1 my life so far is cute , it has an angelic glow to it ; it captures the gorgeous scenery of the argyll countryside and the mannerisms of the eccentric well-to-do pettigrew family . all the performances are first-rate , its storytelling and sense of drama are done in a classy manner , but it is a film that i quickly forgot about when leaving the theater , though i did have a smile on my face . and i say the following in a kindly manner , this is masterpiece theater stuff , appropriately filmed for the mature audience that should appreciate such a blithe period piece . the comedy comes easily in this lush story , as there are the old-film standby gags for comedy : featuring friendly dogs and an adorable kid . the darkest character in the film is the bible toting edward . he is a most perplexing character , wavering between moods of being absolutely charming , to those of being repugnant . it should suit even more than it does me , those who like their art to be " nice and mild . "
rating:0 this was one of the poorer charlie chan episodes . also , the story was much too confusing , with too many characters appearing in uninteresting or unexplainable roles . there was hardly any mystery to this tale , as it barely met the minimum formula requirements for a chan episode . the film is set in paris in 1938 , just at the possible outbreak of ww11 . this mystery doesn't have much of a mystery to it , as there is nothing to guess--the 'bad guys' are plainly evident . firstly , it's unbelievable how such a moron could be given that assignment , as there seemed to be no second-in-command . marcel is plain annoying , he's not funny , and he overacts nonstop .
rating:1 this was the fifth 'invisible man' universal filmed in its ongoing series for the money making sci-fier . john fulton's special effects are the unabashed star of this film . there was one very good trick photography shot of jon hall putting his invisible arm into an aquarium , the arm becoming visible like a bubble and then with water delineating his invisible face to make it visible to those he's threatening . but it is the script that does it in , as the invisible man is made into a heartless villain and the storyline was very weak . warning : spoilers throughout the review . before you can say have some coffee , griffin is also invisible--which is the first experiment drury ever did on a human . in this episode it's not the invisible serum that makes the man insane , as the man is already mentally unbalanced . this hokum story could have and should have been more entertaining , but it still had the presence of the legendary john carradine to give the flick some spice to it . but it was still a far come down from james whale's original invisible man .
rating:3 i was born , but . . . the shochiku kamata studio specialized in nonsense comedies , something the great director , one of the world's most acclaimed , yasujiro ozu ( the tokyo story/late spring/floating weeds ) was keen on doing during this period of his film career , when he refused to make talkies until yielding in 1935 , but continued to make silent social comedies , somewhat in the style and equal to in quality to the charlie chaplin and buster keaton films , though ozu's films were seen through the eyes of children rather than taken from the adult's point of view . they were ably co-scripted by the master of the nonsense film , akira fushimi . in i was born , but . . . , a film with lots of sight-gags , made as a social comedy turning darker as the story got a bit more involved with the patriarch of the family , mr . yoshii ( tatsuo saito ) . this splendid example of a salaryman's film , is the first great film of the master's , with many others to follow . there is a comic sandal fight among the boys , which brings out the film's visual humor from the way the framing of the shots magnifies the synchronized reactions of the two fighters . in fact , ozu's camera angles for adults when talking to children , are always taken from a higher elevation so that the adults are talking down to the children , always in a position of superiority . ozu draws the analogy of the workplace power structure to the way children naturally socialize , and states that the adults power is vindictively social , derived from one's station in life and how much money one has . the home movies become unbearably embarrassing to watch for yoshii and the children , as yoshii acts the part of the clown in them and is seen as an obviously inferior man than his boss . yoshii , himself , is embarrassed that he has to lower himself so much , but he is secretly pleased that he is so successful as a clown and can make everybody laugh . taro's only comment is , your father is really funny . ozu' other purpose of showing the home film , being always the gagman , it also gives him a chance to parody his own way of shooting films by having the home movie filmed in the same style he uses for this movie , such as by using the same tracking shots and camera height angles . the wry salaryman responds , " if i didn't , i wouldn't get paid and you wouldn't eat . " the boys illusion is that all power can be won through one's talents . but in the business world , the boss doesn't have to possess those character traits , he is the boss because that is the way society is structured , and it pays to submit to that hierarchy or else you will be left out in the cold to fend for yourself . the " but " in the film's title comes into place , as it indicates that everyone is born equal , " but " that changes soon enough . there is always something to disturb the stability assumed from the outset . it is now clear that yoshii grovels because he can't do anything else about it . and like many parents in america , he only wishes his children have a better life than he does , which draws him closer to the audience and presents him in a more sympathetic light . the plot of the film is encompassed within a short five-day period , and it parallels in a didactic way the social structure of the children and the grownups , and how in each group adjustments have to be made in order to survive , with the majority of the film being concerned about how the boys start growing up . the adult world is mainly used as a expansion of the boys' limited horizons .
rating:2 an astute political film about an idealistic liberal lawyer concerned with community grass roots issues . the film is so realistic , probably , because it was written by a senator eugene mccarthy speechwriter jeremy larner , who won the oscar for his original screenplay . it is directed by michael ritchie ( downhill racer ) , who does a good job keeping the film afloat with black humor and tension . it thankfully never sinks into melodrama because it stays with the campaign without padding on an unnecessary plot . the only difficulty i had with the film , is that it is not easy to parody the political scene , which is already a parody of itself . this intelligent film shows that better than any other political film i have seen thus far : it magnifies what the seduction of power can do to someone , even an idealist like the redford character . the candidate , though , compromised , still remains a somewhat ambiguous sympathetic figure , someone who still might be effective as a senator , even though he is flawed . which supposedly means , for the moment , what do you have to lose , just be yourself , no one expects you to win . the change in mckay's message is not without misgivings on his part , but what the film does well is keep the focus on the campaign . he also energizes the apathetic electorate with basically the same tired political rhetoric his opponent is saying , but he has charisma and it somehow sounds fresh coming from his lips . it would be too easy to blame it on the system , which this film correctly doesn't do . this hollywood film has passed the test of time and is still a good watch , especially , during an election year . and , even though the times have changed from the 1970s , the political process still looks the same , if that is possible to believe .
rating:0 their romance is believable as long as the story remained in scotland . this is all trite and , for me , unlikely stuff . therefore the animated george of the first half of the film , is reduced to being a passive tourist , everyone showing him a thing or two about their country , and the film flounders , caught between a soft romance and a soft political treatise , accomplishing neither one very successfully . george does the sensible thing for a highly emotional person to do , he splits from here and heads for glasgow , supposedly a better person for having loved abandoningly and made a little bit more politically aware of how bad the contras are by his unexpected adventure . i expect that he'll really have something to say in the pubs when he gets back home , where he belongs . it really wasn't that bad of a film , it was just too flat and preachy . but it was pleasant to watch oyanka cabezas , she was quite innocently alluring , giving her role an authentic tone to it , as there were moments when the story seemed to be reaching for something important to say , and that she would be the best spokesperson to present the cause . but in the end , the film never managed to be all that convincing , probably because it sold its product too hard . and that is unfortunate , because i didn't learn anything new about the nicaraguan political situation that i didn't know before . everything seemed too pat , more like a stanley kramer liberal political film than a former ken loach politically independent film , such as his land and freedom .
rating:0 you can watch this movie , that is based on a sci-fi work by robert heinlein , either as a straight gung-ho war film , or you can see it mostly as a spoof . anyway you watch it won't require too much gray matter from your brain cells , because you will either find this film entertaining and a feast for weary eyes , or you might , like me , " think " that this film is so bad that it really couldn't be this bad , i must be missing something . but i have come to the conclusion that this insipid b- movie , is that bad , despite the high production costs it took to make it . if there are any good parts to this film , it might be in the occasional sardonic one liner , such as this one , that makes light of the film's heavy assault on our sensibilities , as one soldier is telling the hero of the story , " you're good at killing bugs . " basically , the film should be seen as a war movie , because its spoof of the military , grew thin very fast for me , as it got carried away with the cartoon characters it has stereotyped , going for an overkill on a spoof that is so obvious in the first place , that by spending so much time with spoofing the military , is just plain unnecessary . i guess the film is set in the future , but it sure looks like the present to me despite all the computer graphics , as it makes use of its astronomical budget to become solely a computerized special effect movie , that should endear itself to the mtv generation . after awhile , all the performers looked alike to me , but i wouldn't be doing my duty as a movie reviewer , if i should fail to point out that there is some kind of melodramatic love story going down among the four stars of the film , rico ( casper van dien ) , the school football hero , loves carmen ( denise richards ) , the school beauty and math brain , who is set on becoming a pilot , which is the reason rico joins the military . i don't think you get much bang for your money out of this film , unless you are really into special effects or found this sophomoric satire funny or you are a reactionary , then i think you will find many things to like about this empty hearted attempt to put ww11 into an outer space conflagration film .
rating:1 the mystical theme of evil was never fully developed , but the film was well photographed and acted , and the story was very creepy . there were many odd touches that worked very well , that director freddie francis added to this original screenplay by jonathan rumbold & peter spenceley . there's also a surprise ending that fits in well with the film's theme of man's inhumanity . it makes for an above-average horror flick , one that horror fans in particular might enjoy more than others .
rating:3 it is told in flashback , with a voice-over . but even he can't penetrate fedja's severe emotional problems . tremendous emotional energy is brought to the screen by an excellent story and exceptionally fine performances . this a dark film , and it is grimly shot , reflecting this dire mood . what is troubling about the film , is that no alternative way out of this dilemma was explored . in any case , it is better this way than the usual sentimental hollywood rags to riches treatment of such a story . this film is more in the spirit of reading someone like dickens , with strong oedipal emotions added to the bleakness of the story , as it is adapted from a novel by ferdinand bordewijk .
rating:0 " gun shy " puts in a lot of effort to be zanier than the other mobster comedy films it takes the same theme as , except here it is a lawman instead of a hood who is suffering from anxiety attacks and is in need of seeing a shrink . he has a chronic stomach problem , which is used as a running gag throughout . everything is played for laughs ; fidel and fulvio are cartoon figures , with the only difference being oliver platt is funny and jose zuniga is seen as either being psychotic or preening , but he's not funny . this is tv writer eric blakeney's debut feature as director-writer , and he gets mixed reviews . the comedy was mild , the script was choppy , and the story had an inane charm to it , but no more . the usually bland liam neeson had more of a flare for this type of farce than i thought he would have and platt , in his inimical style , got off a few good one-liners , such as " fun is overrated . " sandra bullock , whose acting career is spinning ever-downward , had a small role that only required she look good in that oversized shirt she likes to always wear . overall , the comedy was too slight , as was everything else about this film , to make it more than passable entertainment . its nearest relative in ganster comedy films is " analyze this " ( gun shy was made before that film ) , but this film didn't have de niro as its star , which made this film seem not as good , though it was on the same level . but , if you ask me to state confidentially , the worst thing one can say about this film , i would say that it suffered from too much flatulence .
rating:1 a routine mystery story with a misleading title . this low budget film is watchable , but do not expect anything more than that .
rating:1 party ( director/writer : manoel de oliveira ; screenwriter : agustina bessa-luis ; cinematographer : renato berta ; editor : valerie loiseleux ; cast : michel piccoli ( michel ) , irene papas ( irene ) , leonor silveira ( leonor ) , rogerio samora ( rogerio ) ; runtime : 95 ; gemini films / madragoa filmes ; 1996-portugal / france ) the couple are shown to be avid collectors who like to pretend they care about culture but really have these objects only to impress others . she explains the absurdity of the world by saying , " the world belongs to lunatics like hitler and mussolini -- there're the ones who are most noticeable . " there's a surprise ending , which nicely resolves this little love conundrum . the film appeals to the intellect to answer its questions about love , but fails to be appealing emotionally . it was just too chatty and the characters always seemed to be symbols , too unapproachable to be considered as real people . but i'm a big fan of michel piccoli and irene papas , and i found their performances to be very stimulating--which is reason enough to see this art house film .
rating:2 holy smoke is a beautiful film to watch -- from the feverish credit sequence -- of the film's title written in smoky letters , to kate winslet's psychodelic-like india sojourn , and then onto her trying experiences in the naturally scenic australian outback . the film has perfectly framed scenes and magnificent visuals , and a divertingly amusing storyline to tune into , even if it gives into its own silly side and becomes after a fast start mostly a wonderfully entertaining film touching on many societal nerve points but going nowhere but back into its own cynical view of life , resorting to a politically safe response to all its pin pricks about mind control . though , in all honesty , it should be commended for taking chances and telling its guru story in this refreshingly different style . how perceptive of a film it is , is questionable , as it is provocatively stimulated by overwrought acting and filled with the aussie taste for slapdash comedy and vulgar dialogue . there is too much of a loss of subject context to do any serious intellectual damage about any of the themes it broaches . but it does , on the serious side of its agenda , at least , raise some valid points about mind control and how men treat women . it is scripted by the campion sisters ( jane & anna ) and directed by jane , with a very noticeable woman's touch and a ribald sense of lustiness . at the gathering , there is a gaudily resplendent array of yellow and pink colors to dazzle the senses , seeming more like a light show for a jefferson airplane concert at the fillmore west than a religious ceremony . but mom has trouble adjusting to india : its crowds , lack of modern toilets , and its strange culture . all of their warmth and smiles for her seem disingenuous , especially when compared to the guru's . he also goes heavy on the mouth spray , making sure he is sweet-smelling at all times . the two go off to the outback as p . j . puts into motion his 3-day step program , and the breakdown in the film's sensibility becomes astronomical at this point , making me wonder what the campion sisters were thinking . the film loses its sense of credibility and becomes a battle of the sexes , with the inevitable male-female struggle taking precedence over the heavy-handed religious aspects first introduced into the story . in reality , praying does not guarantee that one's prays will be answered . so , in short , he's not for her , and no matter what he does won't work , which kills the romance part to this screwball comedy . what does this all mean , not too much , except its fun to see keitel get his stereotypical male psyche bruised and ham it up as kate turns the tables on him . but , ah ! those breasts of kate are really something to behold . . . but it is her personality that is the star of the film . she was the only one in the film who wasn't a shallow caricature , and her performance was daring , even smashing , taking this zany script and making the most of it , getting out of it certainly more than it deserved . which means the film actually worked in some skewed sense , as it dove into the question of mind control and the human condition and gave no answers , except the strong suggestion that having compassion for another person is what has to emerge from a person's heart before they can be expected to be free from their karma . and , in a muddled way , this film lets the audience be the observer and lets it come to its own conclusions , which is why i imagine this film will get a mixed-bag of reviews-- ranging from those who can't stand it , to those who rave about it . there were so many wasted moments that blunted this beautifully shot film , that shot itself unecessarily in the foot , even though it did manage to escape from being a dud by its freaky humor and its nonstop assault on the senses of propriety , making this a madcap comedy instead of anything else . it also badly underutilized the talented pam grier , giving her such a miniscule and predictable part , that she had no chance to do her thing . but what it had going for it , is a sense of freedom , an eye for beauty , and kate's undaunting performance , which makes it something to put in your pipe and smoke . if only it wasn't so ridiculous , it could have been a much more salient film , even if it were to lose a few laughs along the way .
rating:3 how could i have imagined as i was making this film that the stifling sense of longing that fills the screen was to become my lot for the rest of my life ; that from now until the end of my days i would bear the painful malady within myself ? " for that reason , seeing how the filmmaker himself was pleased with the film and considered it so important to himself , and because of the power and perfection of craft the film exhibited , it makes it that much easier for me to say that this film ranks as one of his best works , an intriguing masterpiece , that is equal to , if not better than his other masterpieces , solaris , andrei rublyov , the sacrifice , and mirror . the visual images of all the scarved peasant ladies with lit candles and starlings coming out of the virgin's body are , indeed , startling . the mood of the film is gloomy , when a laugh is heard or someone does something silly it is monumental and takes on an unreal scope . the feeling one gets , is somewhat as if a child , saddened by the outside world , is nevertheless able to laugh at something he makes up , and thereby feels good about himself . when the sacristan's response is , " what are you here for , then ? " the best and truest lines in the film are spoken by the madman . the people are much like the weathermen who can give you the temperature , but are lost when the conversation takes a deeper turn , they are simply not prepared to talk about what they do not comprehend . for tarkovsky , this film is a lifetime journey , made by someone who is in pain and must see this pain through for what it is , because there is no going ahead without taking this pain with him . things do not seem so foreign to him , anymore .
rating:2 a powerfully haunting film , that should leave one with some deep emotional pains over its human drama or turn one completely off by its obvious political intentions . this is a banned film in china and one that they will be unlikely to be showing there for quite awhile , as its negative reactions to mao's cultural revolution from 1967-1976 , is a blanket indictment against china's attempt at mass indoctrination . for him , one place is like another , so it makes no difference that he is in so barren a region . it is sheer madness the way this program is administered and carried out , whereas no one comes for her when her time is up and there is no one there to tell her anything . that she panics , thinking she will be left here for good , is understandable . the film shows by comparing her mood swings to the natural surroundings , the vast and changing sky , how small she feels , how it has sunk into her how far apart she is from the things she loves to do and how much she misses her warm family . by contrast , it is shown how comfortable lao jin is here . it is a most interesting performance by this 16-year-old actress , lu lu , which gets the audience feeling sorry for her , but at the same time , feeling annoyed that she acts so badly against the saintly herder . it is a uniquely masterful performance , that seldom gets translated on the screen in such a true way as it does here . the flaw in the film , comes with its bleak ending , that seemed to be contrived and used as a means of getting more sympathy out of the audience than it needed to . it took away from the impact of this strange relationship , that had been mesmerizing and touching in a very real way . it returned the film to the heavy-handed symbolic message it had succeeded in avoiding through the telling of its energetic human drama . the beautiful camera shots of the landscape and the poetry of the girl's loss of innocence , were undermined to a certain degree by how this allegory unfolded . xiu xiu's story is sad one , but one wonders if it was really so overwhelming as it is portrayed here . nevertheless , this was a substantial film , that had its heart in the right place and offers a story that is of a superior quality . overall , a splendid effort is achieved .
rating:1 as you might surmise from a mainstream film like this , it wants to pull you along with all the heartaches it can muster from these lonely souls , and it does so , by making use of semi flashbacks and scenes that have a mixture of fantasy and reality to it . to a lesser degree , this style of filmmaking also works for the less complicated pat , as his mental grief comes pouring out in spurts . the film's title , living out loud , is deliberately misleading , as it should really be retitled as " fantasizing out loud . " this therefore becomes a film more intrigued with self-awareness than with relationships and loses its edge as a romantic film . its brightest hope is how the viewer relates to the film's stars . i didn't , so the film just seemed to drag for me at times and it seemed manipulative , to the bargain . my problem is that i didn't really care what happened to them . why they were sad and lonely , is a sympathetic enough story , but there was just nothing served up that made me feel that this predictable story had anywhere important to go . the only innovative feature of the film , which did save it from the doldrums , was that we were able to go inside their heads and hear their thinking process at work . the filmmaker has borrowed this guise of introspection from the pages of chekhov , which works out reasonably well on film , though it is still better served as a device for the reader of books . at least the film never turns to mush , as its static atmosphere is enhanced mostly by some of the lively nightclub scenes , such as when liz is belting out her sultry jazz numbers and offering good cheer for advice ( trust me , it wasn't on a par to the biblical solomon's advice ) . but i couldn't picture them falling in love for even a second and certainly not for a minute , these two were just not compatable . but come to think of it , she's pretty dull herself . the fantasy she has of making it with the hunk masseur ( cibrian ) , who gives her the sex massage she dreams of , are the kind of private thoughts that perhaps more people have than what is commonly thought , but this is certainly not a way to self-discovery and a way out of her situation , though it seems to help her in someway , but the film has really not made it clear how she was helped . this bittersweet romance turns out to be too dry for my taste ; but , it is , nevertheless , faultlessly told and seems to be sincere in its presentation , and what the heck , they seem to be ok people , and probably merit a tad of sympathy for their plight . his attempt here to make a combination fantasy and a straight romance film , has worked with mixed results . i think the major fault for the film's dullness lies with the co-stars ; i couldn't get aroused by holly hunter's performance , as intelligent as it was , it was still too plain and too staid . while danny de vito , who is a natural comic and is best at being featured as a second-banana , wasn't funny enough here and couldn't be taken seriously enough as a romantic suitor for holly . i'm not saying that he was completely miscast , he did bring some depth to his character's anguished situation and believability to his role . but someone else , a more romantic leading man , might have given the film a romantic tension to it that it desperately needed . though i realize the point of the story was that these two weren't really suited for each other in the first place and that this was the odd twist to their non-romance . but my point is , that they could have been not suited for each other all right , but not by such a wide margin as these two were . but that was also too predictable an ending , limiting the scope of the film .
rating:1 penny , like the audience , gets used to these freaks and begins to see them as very gentle and touching human beings , and her heart , not her sex , goes out to them . at this point , the story could have gone in a number of directions , there were just so many themes it touched on , but chooses not to sensationalize its tale , instead it becomes a very sobering tear-jerker . though there were some moments for levity , as when blake tells penny , " maybe i'll see you when i'm single , " the film , nevertheless , remains too sober for its own good . but all they see at this party are people who are less normal than they are . they have a few more contacts with worldly people , with mixed results . the symbolism here , is that even if religion means well , it still does the wrong thing even when doing the right thing . so it is not surprising that they are very effective and convincing in their peculiar roles . the female part of their menage a trois , was played energetically by michele hicks , but was a somewhat less believable role than the twins . the whore with a heart of gold is already a staple of film lore and she brings nothing new to the table with this performance . her acting contrasted between being particularly touching to being strident and , at times , she was not very accomplished in her part . the other characters and especially the mother , had either too small a part to have an impact ; or , were not developed at all . the intensity of the film and its haunting nature worked to its benefit , as it made us see the twins as they are ; the film pulled no punches and stuck to the compelling nature of its subject matter . but these same advantages also worked to the detriment of the film , as the story was , at times , tiresome and rife with too much territory in which to go for all the problems it came up with . the film couldn't free itself from all the pain entailed in the three characters , and kept making the story more and more muddled . an example of that , would be the film's ending , where penny encounters the now single blake and possible romance is hinted at , but the story just seems to be warming up as it ends on such an unclear note . this original film had too many flaws in its storytelling and never became an inspiring drama or an entertaining work . it should be commended for its mesmerizing style and enormous strength it showed in sticking with an unpleasant subject most films do not usually cover . the brothers had something to say , but perhaps it was too much for them to say in one film , even in a film with a perfectly eerie cinematography to match its storyline . it is a film that has its heart , seemingly , in the right place ; it , nevertheless , missed the boat on telling the sexual story it promised but never delivered . a prostitute not having sex with a client who requested it is hard story to forget so easily , as it seems , if done right , that could have been an innovative and moving scene and helped the film recover from being too bleak . the film got caught up too much in the tragedy of the twin's life and dwelt too much on the gravity of their situation without coming up with much more than heavy symbolism for its answers ( chopsticks broken in half , a two dollar bill as change in a cab and later on the subject of a lecture by the good doctor telling how if the bill is torn in half it is not worth as much as if it were whole ) . i found those explanations to be too trite , and since i was never fully convinced that this wasn't a manipulative film , playing on the freakish nature of the brothers even if not sensationalizing it , i left the theater not fully satisfied with all of the storyline .
rating:1 a verbose talk-fest , which is a play more than a visual film experience , as adapted by sidney lumet from ira levin's broadway play about a parlor murder game . lumet as always , sucks any subtlety out of his films . here he is in a bit of a frenzy in portraying the characters , relying more on plot twists than character development . in comparison with a similar-type of stage play put to the silver screen , joseph l . mankiewicz's sleuth , lumet's is clearly the inferior one . at this point , the film had a fluidity and a macabre comical tone to it . but , it changes in a drastically different direction , and the surprises in the plot , from here on , come about faster than a venice beach skateboarder trying to impress the bystanders . what eventually shines through , is how clever and manipulative the script is . i felt used by the characterizations , as it took away a lot of the pleasure derived from the snappy dialogue and the absurdity of the storyline , that in the first act , worked really well . caine seemed marvelous at first , but i soon tired of his constantly frantic look . it was dyan cannon , with her sweet giggles and frustrated looks , who brought a needed restraint to the film , and as long as she was onscreen the film had an edge to it . too many contrivances made everything seem so superficial , which is a shame , because the film did have its funny moments .
rating:1 polar ( director/writer/editor : jacques bral ; screenwriter : from a book by jean-patrick manchette " morgue pleine " /jean-paul leca ; cinematographers : jacques renoir/jean-paul rosa da costa ; editors : anne boissel/noun serra ; cast : jean-fran ? ois balmer ( eugene tarpon ) , sandra montaigu ( charlotte le dantex ) , pierre santini ( inspecteur coccioli ) , roland dubillard ( jean-baptiste haymann ) , claude chabrol ( theadore lyssenko ) , jean-paul bonnaire ( gerard sergent ) , marc dudicourt ( le loup ) , g ? rard loussine ( c ? sar ) , jean-louis foulquier ( alfonsino ) ; runtime : 97 ; les films noris ; 1984-france ) a dark , atmospheric film noir from france , that followed to the letter all the conventions of that genre . it was properly shot in b & w , which gave it that 1940s look . there are a few more surprise plot twists in a story that winds down in a muddled fashion , as the characters and the story are not clearly defined . the film was too much in awe of what film noir is supposed to be like to have much of a breath of its own , but this b-film was entertaining and the two main characters balmer and montaigu had a lot of spunk . this limited film is a good example of an escape film that delivers some mild thrills , but can't overcome becoming a clich ? of the movie it was parodying .
rating:0 the film is filled with violence , vulgar dialogue , and seems devoid of real feelings . it relies on twists in the plot to keep you tuned into the investigation and shocking scenes to keep you aghast at the horrors of being in vietnam . the acting was flat , the story was trite , and the suspense was marginal .
rating:2 testament of dr . the film was well-crafted , perfectly photographed in b&w , as it maintained a breezy pace and threw into the story some comedy and romance . they are not told how they will die until they hear a loud ticking sound . the whole feel of the movie is that it's brilliant hokum . aside from its serious political message , this was a slapstick comedy , and a mystery story much influenced by those american serials , which were very popular at the time . it is definetly worth seeing .
rating:1 the film seems like a museum piece , about a time that existed long ago but strangely enough , probably , still exists . the story is told in a dry , matter-of-fact style , with the b&w photography adding a gritty feel to the secretive work environment and the snow-capped streets of ottawa . this picture had the look of something that was important , but it didn't have more to say than what any reasonable person could already assume about the soviet union .
rating:3 now this is an indie cult film , if ever there was one . they sell both bibles and guns , two contrasting products that fit very well into the mainstream of american society , makes for a most interesting commentary on the american landscape , as directed and written by the south african , daniel j . harris . this b/w , gritty film , is so well-paced and flies by so quickly , that you feel you know these men in the short time span you meet them and you don't want the film to end before you find out just what happens to them , as things begin to turn sour for them . this unique film , in the style of the maysles brother's the salesmen , packs a wallop and a sales pitch that goes beyond the ordinary pseudo-documentary and improvisational work . the theme of the film is really geared for the 1960s in psychology , in the music played and in the dress and style of the salesmen . but were're in the '90s all right and that only adds weight to the idea that these men are really dead already but they just don't know it . these very repulsive reactionary types are so-well caught on camera , as they go from reading the script to ad libbing without missing a beat , in fact the unrehearsed scenes have a special flair about them that is macabre . one of the really powerful scenes , is the opening one when they are selling the collectors' edition bible set and a defender 500 pump-action shotgun in a trailer , it is almost unnerving that they keep a straight face when they say to the poor whites they are selling this to , " the american family deserves to be well-armed and well-read . " the director seems to imply , isn't that what america is about , anyway . they sold me on this film . these " stars " certainly bring a level of authenticity to the film that is uniquely satifsying . this , suprisingly enough , is a not to be missed film , if you can ever locate it on cable .
rating:2 john alton is an excellent cinematographer , with noir films being his specialty , as his camera knows how to capture that shadowy world of half-lit images and dark background scenery . his camera work adds the extra-element of suspense and by using many different and odd camera angles he makes things seem unbalanced , something that works rather well for this nightmarish tale . in this film , the director and the cinematographer are fortunate to have a tight , tough , no-nonsense script to work with and they make the best of it , touching a raw nerve or two , as the film is fast-paced and packed with scenes that are shockingly brutal . this film is one of the best kept noir secrets , as it is not mentioned enough when powerful noir films are discussed by aficionados of the genre . this is usually the man's role in such films . we have witnessed a special poetic moment in noir film , a shot that has since become a classic , telling more in its noir imagery than words could ever express . this was the weakest scene in the movie . it seemed too contrived , as the killer's wild comment to them was , " i killed her but i don't know why ; i deserve to die . " but it , somehow , sounds to her , that he is saying it to ann not her . the photography is electric , consisting of low angle shots and reflections of light coming in from the open window , giving the scene a naturally eerie look and a depth perception creating the illusion of how far apart the men have now become in their lives , as the light from the candelabra highlights the shadows in the room . this fatalistic drama ends in total violence , with no winners . it's a sad reminder of burning desires and romantic dreams going up in flames . claire's voiceover narration gives the film some added chills , and the three main characters become studies in emotional deprivation , giving the film an added depth in its character study . the acting was first-rate . the look of the film was beyond reasonable expectations of how good a noir film should look . the sexual tension was penetrating . this was , to say the very least , an interesting work .
rating:2 this film will evoke memories of films such as chinatown and the bad and the beautiful , and of the starlets of that era , lana turner , veronica lake , and rita hayworth . the feel of the movie is of nostalgia for the hollywood glamorous life of that period , at least it presents what we are led to believe is glamorous , while the paparazzi click their cameras at the action and work hand-in-hand with the cops , hoping to catch a hollywood figure with narcotics , or in bed with someone who they shouldn't be with , or get the goods on some commies in hollywood . there are so many wonderful performances , that it is difficult to say which one is the best , but the russell crowe , dumb tough guy , muscle man cop , takes the cake as far as i am concerned , it gives the film the raw energy and view point it wants to get across , as he believes whole heartedly in what he is doing , as he beats confessions out of those accused of crimes and works over others to get information . and believe it or not , these are the two most virtuous ones in this flick . cromwell is deceptively engaging as the police chief , with a heavy irish accent and with the demeanor of a politically connected cop , who could look you straight in the eye and make you feel as if you were talking to someone who has the goods on you . his role in the film is crucial for our understanding of the underlying sentiment of how the l . a . police force has relished its role as savior for the citizenry , even if it has to defy what the book says is the right way to conduct a criminal investigation . the film is long , but it moves at a very brisk pace , covering a multitude of sub-plots . the most disturbing thing about the movie , might not be that disturbing if you believe that justice doesn't work , anyway , and that if the criminal element gets pounded on , then , so what , they are only criminals who would be getting away with crime completely if not for these rogue cops . maybe the filmmakers are right in their slick attitude , or maybe this film is just pure entertainment . but the film loaded the deck for any other argument , and that is what deters me from going overboard and praising this film to the heavens , even if it is an exceptionally well-made , cynically humorous , and terrifically acted picture ; but , yet , it might not be as great as it appears , since its subliminal message is that you can't change the system .
rating:1 my darling ! ) for a hammer film , this one is as good it gets for them . it's a bizarre psychological story with lots of hitchcock's psycho in it . it's a disturbing film about a hostage situation involving an insane religious fanatic . tallulah bankhead plays the bible quoting nut mrs . trefoile , in an over-the top performance that is frightening to behold . as crazy as the tale was , it all seemed possible .
rating:1 strange bargain ( director : will price ; screenwriters : from a story j . h . a well-conceived mystery b-film , but strictly second feature material .
rating:1 warner oland's final appearance as charlie chan is marred because this is one of the weaker episodes in the long running series . the story was too muddled and not too crisply executed . for comedy , lee's misuse of french leads to some embarrassing situations and joubert's choppy english and inflated pride in his bumbling police department leads to some amusing moments .
rating:1 barlach's grumpy demeanor , the strange circumstances of the case , and the unsettling swiss countryside , add a noir feel to this b & w film . martin ritt , who is usually a film director , plays his part with all the right quirks and nuances to make his role quite interesting . he reminded me a lot of peter falk's columbo . voight is a good counterbalance to ritt and to robert shaw's one-dimensional nazi-like villain role . he is able to bring an energy into the investigation , something that makes the implausible situation seem a little bit more plausible . but the ending , when all the game plans come together , left me slightly irked-- this easy to watch film , just didn't add up . it seemed as if the story tried too hard to make sure that man's sense of justice won't be mocked anymore , and i just couldn't buy into its easy solution , especially when for most of the film , confusion was the telling story .
rating:2 the film does a marvelous job of giving us a feel about life in the early part of the 20th century and how resolute some genuine seekers of the truth were in carrying on the arguments of religious orthodoxy versus scientific reality . since he can't find anything phony about these photos , he is pressed into believing that maybe it is possible to prove that there is a spiritual world with such creatures in attendance . his tendency is to believe that faith is what we must live by : " i don't need proof , faith is enough for me . " one of the problems with the film , that took away some of its luster , was that charles acted in such a one dimensional manner , jumping from non-believer to a firm believer in fairies in such a rapid time , that it was hard to fathom what was going on in his head . therefore his story did not have the impact it could have had with a more drawn out response and introspective performance . he was not someone that we could warm up to in an instant without knowing more about him than his tragic loss . now kingsley's role is really structured to fit a rigid character who can't change , yet his presence on screen is dynamic , bringing much more to his villainous role than just that one dimension to it . we might not like him but we have a better understanding of him than we do of charles . wanted to like charles much more than we were given a chance to and we couldn't , mainly because we could never get close enough to him . but that is not to say his performance wasn't good . it was well-suited according to character , but it was not a stirring performance and not one that completely captured our imagination . what results is a film that is beautifully photographed and stimulating to the intellect and freshly innovative . and , for how many films can you say all that is true ? we are led to believe that religion doesn't work because it is too fearful to go inward ; that theosophy doesn't work because it is not a real experience for those partaking in their seances and pseudo-scientific experiments ; and , that science doesn't work because its knowledge is limited . but the love story remains secondary to the ideas presented about the afterworld ; her romantic interest in him just never becomes vital to the story . where the story is strongest and most convincing , is when it tries to debunk both the belief and disbelief in fairies . there is no rational argument he can present to edify what he knows for certain . this is a very intelligent and effective film , that raises many interesting ideas and questions about the supernatural . it is a serious film , that should be seen by an audience that is not afraid of a story with an unhappy ending ; it offers a fresh outlook to a meaningful experience about the afterworld . this topic has been virtually taboo in our culture ever since the '60s drug revolution imploded on the landscape and caused a generational war . but it is now the end of the century , and the questions alluding to a spiritual world and the use of psychedelics as one way to get there , are more relevant than ever . if there are quibbles with this imperfect film , they are not that significant when you consider how well it made its case about an afterworld . this is something western mystics might find easier to believe than others ; but , in any case , one seeking the truth still must choose which spiritual conditions to aspire to , and this film presents one such option . that this mysterious story was so captivating , showing how necessary it was for charles to find his place there and how believable his quest was , speaks highly of how well this film was crafted by the director .
rating:0 a showtime original movie that results in a very strained comedy/mystery story , one that is more stupid than offbeat and less noir than in the mode of a sophomoric film school work . it tries so hard to waver between reality and being completely off-the-wall , until it succumbs to being mostly annoying and far too cute looking for it to be appealing , yet not funny enough to be worth the effort of setting up such an inane story . i can only recommend it for those who want to see amanda plummer perform her magical acting ability as a psychic . she can do no wrong , no matter how rotten this made-for-tv film is or how ridiculous her part is , as she sticks out like a rose in a weed garden , plying her talents as a sex-craved psychic for the police . the wonder view apartments has a swimming pool that is polluted with slime and filled with debris and it has an assortment of odd and annoying tenants , from wise guy roller skaters to corny lovebirds . all the while , the story revolves around stan's study of psychology in the sterile college atmosphere , where rats are experimented in a maze to study human behavior , which is compared to how invigorating it is to study people's behavior in a real setting , as he finds people in this setting act the same way the rats behave in a maze . this might have been funny , if there was some credulity to their picking on the dumbfounded stan , who has an airtight alibi . but the film defeated itself by trying to be both real and absurd , thereby nothing caught fire , it all seemed like every man and woman was out for themselves to see if they can get a laugh somehow from a story that was going nowhere . the film failed doubly , both as a comedy and as a mystery . there were so many gaps in the story , that one can easily make a case that nothing made sense and what was funny , was merely only silly . this is a low point in storytelling , as the director has failed to keep this shallow film above even the low water mark it set for itself .
rating:1 it's an absorbing story but it was presented in such a mangled way , so a lot of the drama was sucked out of it and it instead became an obvious sob story about an injustice done . this steven zaillian directed film has traces of the same intelligence he has shown in his previous work as director of searching for bobby fischer and as a screenwriter for schindler's list , but loses its fire-power with scenes of endless court hagglings and what seems like an interminable amount of time spent in giving prep classes on how the court system works . this sets-up a battle of david versus goliath . the supporting players all have limited roles compared to the two gunslingers , travolta and duvall , but perform admirably . for all its telling faults in its storytelling ability , the film had an aura of reality about it that the john grisham movies never have . while duvall is shown as the masterful machiavellian tactician with absolutely no heart , whose m . o . what the film failed to do , is to bring a sense of urgency to their presentation . though they were sympathetic to the families' plight and caught the essence of what travolta was up against , which makes it better than most hollywood films , it just couldn't drive the fastball thrown down the middle of the plate over the 'green monster' in fenway park for a home run . the story became less than compelling and more of an exercise about who was the better actor/lawyer duvall or travolta . the great social impact of the lawsuit never caught on during the film , when that should have been the driving force of the film , as it was when grippingly told in the book .
rating:1 a superficial scare film that makes a feeble attempt to serve up hamlet as its theme , but that's a stretch . it didn't seem believable . he was certainly no bundle of warmth in their hour of need ! it's a film that is devoid of subtlety as its shocks are not surprising and its unfulfilling revenge ending in terms of 'an eye for eye' was poorly scripted ; it also failed to be convincing or scary . it was just another mindless slasher film . the film spends most of its time showing the couple pretending to be nice but still looking creepy . the film has a cold and steely look to it , as feelings on everyone's part are chilly . the house itself is smothered in a cold , aqua blue , as the production designer , jon gary steele , and the director of photography , alar kivilo , have made the set to look like a clone of the antagonistic and cold-hearted terry glass . there was no suspense because if you ever watched any of these formulaic flicks then you will know how this one ends . the film's slow pace for such a slight story bordered on criminality . this is basically a film that put a great effort into getting the sets it wanted to be right , but failed to get anything more out of this absurd tale . it was never believable , but its conclusion was even more ridiculous than it had a right to be .
rating:1 it was a hit at the 1998 afi filmfest . wade didn't see what happened and he doesn't know if he should believe jane , but he doesn't like her solution to the problem and the two of them show that they are cut from a different cloth . the film has the minimal amount of dialogue and holds our attention because the protagonist is a good guy , who ironically can only find freedom when he's in a real prison . the film's main flaw , is that it proves its point by wrapping things up with too nice of a pink bow tied around it .
rating:1 following on the heels of " the exorcist " , " the omen " is another box-office success , one of many commercial horror thrillers spawned in the 1970s , and much better critically than most others . it is even a more satisfying film than the exorcist . what makes this film so captivating , is how it relies on narrative and not special effects to build on tension . this adorable cherub turns out to be none other than the antichrist . or maybe , by taking the bible literally , that can become a problem . how this film gets to hold its head higher than most of the other films of this nature , is because the acting is first-class , the telling of the story is tight , and the criss-crossing between london , rome , and jerusalem , is suspenseful . the film is in constant motion , so it is made difficult to stop and think , and reflect how much hokum there is in the story . so , i can't really blame the very prudish and politically sensible thorn for not believing the priest . this gets thorn's attention , at last . all this leaves the ambassador befuddled , looking only as gregory peck can look , when things that are supposed to make sense don't . while in jerusalem , there are a few more shocks , and the story excitedly swings back to london . here , a few more shocks develop . the film succeeds because it knows how to tell a suspenseful story and not rely on green vomit for its shocks , like the exorcist resorted to , as the omen manages to have its shocks look sensible and seem convincing .
rating:0 much ado is made about aspidistra in this comedy adapted from the semi-autobiographical novel of george orwell . there's a point to be made in this 1930s depression satire about money counting for everything , and this point is hammered into every aspect of the story , until it gets to be not only redundant , but outright irritating to hear . the story quickly makes its point , as valid as it might be in orwell's novel , here it seems trivial , that people delude themselves into thinking that they are the next shakespeare and spend a miserable time living in poverty or doing what they shouldn't be doing , when they would be much happier being accepted into the middle-class where they duly belong . it's a fair enough point made , but the story has this nasty habit of being saccharine to a point , where its sugary qualities could be fatal to the viewer's heart . even the scenes of poverty are sugar-coated , making everything look so awfully nice . something gordon can't do . it also , somehow , stretches the point of art and advertisement having much in common , cynically stating there is little difference between how they achieve their ends . the message i got , as i watched this tepid middle-brow , so-called art film , is that living in poverty can be stifling , and that kind of life is not what makes an artist . for a movie railing against accepting bourgeoisie values - it instead becomes a movie that ends up glorifying those values . its final message is that there is no escape from one's destiny . if one looked hard enough , there can be found some wit in gordon's portrayal of a likable jerk with artistic ambitions and some charm in his relationship with rosemary . but this uninspired script cannot find anything relevant to say to make this satire meaningful . you'll get a better feel of what orwell was trying to satirize reading that book than you will by seeing this film .
rating:3 cameron crowe ( say anything . . . /singles/jerry the film is not raucous rock , but offers a sweet view of the music world , pointing out why its popularity is high among adolescents , while also exploring its business side . the casting was perfecto , not that the acting was necessarily arresting , but it was that everyone seemed natural for their roles and gave expression and a sense of truth to what was happening . all you can do is write about them honestly . that will be the mantra of the film and also its hardest attack on the industry , but it is carried out to perfection by this great cast and directed with a sure-hand for drawing out the comedy and whatever goodness there is in the artists and the groupies who follow them . but the film will go on to show that everyone connected with the music is delusional , the musicians are not as serious about their music as they pretend to be and the " band aids " are only fooling themself if they think they're not groupies , as they stroke their unsatisfied egos by basking in the glory of someone else . he , thusly , fails to heed lester's advise . what i thoroughly enjoyed about the film was the casual way it let its characters act and be themselves , even if it was rehashing characters and rock music scenes played out in many such films , but here it seemed to be very easy to absorb and take in without dissecting that 1970s hippie scene . instead , it let the story make whatever sense it could without going overboard . i doubt very much if the film caught the full-flavor of that period , but it did catch what it had to , and all the characters avoided falling into being stereotypes . billy crudup is a very fine actor and he is able to be different things to different people in this film without making it seem as if he were disingenuous . the film might not have been flawless , with some mild lapses in character development ( groupies were thinly sketched ) and the story resolvement was not convincing ( a contrived bumpy plane landing scene , where the band fearing death confess what they really think of each other ) , but the overall zeal of the film overtakes those gaffs and allows the film to be much better than being merely a nostalgia film , and much more entertaining than any serious rock film i have seen . cameron crowe seems to have found a niche in making teen films that are much better than teen films . he seems to have an ageless sympathy for teenagers and for those who teens idolize , not categorizing them as either good or bad people . also , this film is suitable for both parents and kids , r rating or not , which is not an easy chore to accomplish when making a hip film . but moms should like it , as the frances mcdormand characterization was more eccentric and mannered than one-dimensional , and after all , the kid listened to her and didn't take any drugs ( at least it wasn't shown in the story ) .
rating:3 roman polanski sets up a tense atmosphere for this macabre tale , where every black-and-white shot is subjectively motivated by the deranged character played with quiet brilliance by catherine deneuve , until the final shot becomes one of objective reality . the only thing to be said in favor of these ghastly murders are that these men were not nice and were extremely pushy , wanting to use her and not caring that she didn't even show the slightest interest in them . this is an austere and timeless grand guignol work , one with little dialogue . this is the first of roman polansky's english language film's and his second feature ( the first was " knife in the water " -1962 ) , and this one might be his best work . it is eerie , unsettling and intelligently created , showing deneuve's emotional breakdown in an impactful way , by showing it in psychological terms of deterioration and not as a creation of special effects . this is a scary film , one of the best in the world of horror films .
rating:1 the stars of the film , who play a married couple , are probably playing out on screen a lot of what their married life was like before their real-life divorce . this film has both the look of a daytime tv soaper and a cheapie movie . i can't begin to explain why he does that , unless he is so arrogant and bored with life that he feels he has to do it . i found enough interest in this film to say that it is not completely without merit , but i did not think it told a crisp enough story to make it anything but one of chabrol's experimental so-so films . for the film to say , that men always ask questions and women don't , is not exactly a modern attitude to have these days , and it was unclear to me what chabrol's thinking about this really was , whether it was an ironical attitude or a stab at saying something that was so ridiculous that no one could take it seriously . chabrol has made a career out of being vague in his films , and more often than not it has worked to his benefit , but not this time .
rating:1 in his short career , mark wahlberg has been most effective when playing characters full of na ? ve sincerity . in boogie nights , the yards , and even three kings , his talent is in making the audience believe he's a good guy with a lot of heart , just trying his best . the problem with the film lies in director stephen herek's inability to take advantage of the strengths that wahlberg displays . herek ( bill and ted's excellent adventure , mr . holland's opus ) , directing a screenplay from crazy/beautiful director john stockwell , does rely on wahlberg's sincerity at first -- we easily sympathize with chris' work ethic and passion -- but doesn't allow it to carry the movie later , when the film could really use it . from that point on , rock star unfortunately takes itself a little too seriously , taking time to document stuff we've already read about ( it is a full 15 years later , after all , and hair bands like motley crue have been telling these stories for a while ) . rock star would've been better off as a bigger satire of the time , ripping into the music , the people , and the period , and allowing wahlberg's wide-eyed , once-in-a-lifetime experiences to anchor the movie's emotional honesty and sympathy . aniston could have certainly contributed to that ; i can't imagine too many people staring into those expressive eyes on the big screen and not empathizing with the woman . that would go a long way in getting us deeper into the characters , but it doesn't happen . herek does direct the concert scenes with a certain urgency and is able to capture that arena rock experience , as cool or ridiculous as you might think it is . but as chris finds his way in the final act , the movie breaks down a bit , more interested in having us feel good than actually being sincere to the story . they should've asked mark wahlberg about sincerity -- he knows how it should work . rating : * * * |------------------------------| \ * * * * * perfection \ \ * * * * good , memorable film \ \ * * * average , hits and misses \ \ * * sub-par on many levels \ \ * unquestionably awful \ |------------------------------|
rating:2 the family is more complex than a mob family has a right to be , and the philosophical lines they spout , in this slow-moving , almost actionless film for this genre , sometimes seems bizarre but has a strange pull to it , one that keeps you wondering what's going on with these dangerous criminals , as their lives begin to unravel during the funeral . this is the most powerful scene in the film and it is brilliantly accomplished . but the film can't end on that prosaic note , this film is heading down a more philosophical and catholic path , as the end is so unexpected and makes so little sense , no matter how you try to explain it , that we can only guess what the director means . the picture works despite the bizarre ending , because it is gritty and seems real , in the sense that so many families are dysfunctional in america , that there is no reason why a long-standing mob family shouldn't also be plagued with family problems . chris penn's performance earned him the " best supporting actor " award at the 1996 venice film festival and the film won the special jury prize . but i didn't think he was something special , as much as he gave the film energy . the gallo character , despite a lot of attention placed on it , is never uncovered , and his performance only seemed adequate . he has a great line , though , where he says , " life is pointless without the movies . " i thought the glue to this film , was walken's mesmerizing performance , who is able to say with a straight face , that the flaw in a criminal's character , is that he is not trustworthy . he and his wife are the only characters that i really felt for , who seemed to be touching something deep down and bringing it up for examination . that is the message ferrara brings with this anti-gangster gangster film , who digresses to talk about other topics such as capitalism and sexual kinkiness , but only in a cursory way . the film has a black humor to it and a dark side that is darker than the typical 1940 noir films were . the emotions here are allowed to run over the screen and , all the diversions to the plot and even the plot itself , are not as important as delving into the emotional make up of the lead characters . it is an engrossing film , one of the better gangster films , even though it is flawed by the director's inability to stay in focus and maintain a coherent narrative .
rating:1 the gift is a supernatural thriller whose motto is : 'always follow your instincts . ' unfortunately because of that glitch in the story and the film's gapping holes in logic , i wasn't absorbed by this moody and atmospheric thriller as much as i should have been . when you see how the film will be resolved before the main character does and that person is playing a psychic , then there is something amiss about the story . the suspense always felt tacked on to all the psychic visions that dramatically kept the pot boiling . this ploy always felt contrived and the film never quite felt real . ribisi's portrayal was hammy and particularly uninteresting . the trial was poorly filmed and made a mockery of how a trial should be run . this whodunit had many contrivances and they all sapped strength from the film's already rather weak mystery story . the two things that kept this film watchable were the suspenseful visuals of annie's dark visions -- eerily recalling things from the dead world , and cate's gifted performance , that brought more to the story than the script by billy bob thornton and tom epperson could provide . as a hollywood film it fails to deliver enough punch to be a box-office hit , but as a b-film it seems easier to overlook the film's lack of punch to its story and accept its ordinary gothic story as possibly having more to it than presented .
rating:3 one of the great silent films of all time . it was also one of the most offbeat psychological dramas ever produced by a major studio , especially one such as mgm . the collaboration between director/writer tod browning , himself a one time circus performer , and the intense performance by lon chaney , was a thing of magic . this was a vengeful , gruesome and scary scene . " the unknown " is a tightly made film , with a sinister plot and a startling and intense performance by chaney . the film presents an excellent study of character , though its theme is morbid and boiling with hatred it is still appealing because of its edginess .
rating:3 habit , supposedly a vampire movie , but , perhaps , it is more like a psychological thriller/love story . he looks out of it as he stumbles along , and as he looks around in disbelief , he sees the other celebrants in their costumes , and just goes stumbling on , not quite so sure if the scary creatures he is seeing are for real or induced from his inebriated state . you feel sam's agony of living in such a crowded city as n . y . , constantly hearing its pulsating city rhythms , experiencing its dark fears , and you are always aware of the noise and many distractions there are , especially when you need space to think . but one thing is certain , something bad is happening to him . what makes this vampire type of film different than the others , is that it is very personal , more about the psychological state of a guy who doesn't seem to be a psychotic , but is very confused about the new direction his life is taking him . most of the other films of this kind seem so unreal in regards to any kind of personal underpinnings that are frightening to them , that the fright in them appears to be from watching good filmmaking , not from something that can possibly crop up in their daily lives or invade their inner being . fessender has fully thought out the details of how a person can break down in front of us and not have any recourse in putting a stop to it , making the story as plausible and far-reaching as possible . there are a lot of things that happened involving relationships and inner perceptions , that you need time and peace of mind to think about , just as sam needed , that might never make sense . but that isn't the point . . . it is usually the things that don't make sense , that bother us the most . the film has a captivating style and playful mood to it , that keeps you involved in the intelligently told story , which is rare for this genre .
rating:1 this is another in a long line of indie 'buddy films' about desperadoes going on the road . the only thing different about this one , is that it is consciously played for laughs , which gets it through its cartoonish lowbrow humor , as it features characters who all have something about them that is dysfunctional : they are illiterate , have a depraved mental condition , suffer from greed , or just like to kill people . it's a teenager's version of the noir classic " the treasure of sierra madre , " lacking the breath and depth in its story to touch base with the classic , but letting its own dimwitted energy do its talking , for what it stands for . the road it takes is across the southwestern desert and across the barren culture of the white trash trailer park crowd . she's a mute and communicates by writing . there is nothing that we haven't seen before in such road films , from a vintage car convertible to a gun fetish to white trash humor , and finally to random violence , but there is a surprise ending here involving , what else , but , betrayal for the gold . even though there were many look-alike films , this black comedy could at least stand alone for the laughs it presented . the characters all had personality , and the force of the movie overall , had a desirable effect , even if it is an easy film to forget and requires as little thinking as possible when viewing . enjoyable nonsense might be an apt description for former adman rod mccall's second feature .
rating:1 the charles dickens influence is evident on griffith's work , as the complications to this simple plot keeps getting more involved in the political trials of the revolutionary times . it also gave the director a chance to pontificate against the more current bolshevic revolution of 1917 . the popularity of the play inspired at least one french and three american film adaptations . it's not a film without major faults , which include stilted acting , clumsy characterizations , an implausible tale , and laughable melodrama . but somehow the well-intentioned sincerity of the story plows its way through the mess and the film is interesting as both a museum curio and for the raw emotions expressed by the suffering sisters . it is also noted for its rough characterization of robespierre , its beautiful costumes and authentic looking mob scenes , capturing the chaos of the times . but it still should prove to be of interest mainly to film buffs rather than the general public . he was someone who believed that if you didn't think like him , you were evil . the excessively melodramatic story is one that tugs at the heart strings , but makes up for so much goo by conveying griffith's history lesson : that the french revolutionists rightly overthrew a bad government , but unfortunately allowed dictatorial mob rule to take over . how the film works for you , depends on what you can overlook about it that is creaky and what you can accept about it that is grandiose . it has not aged well , but i found it worth seeing for its historical value and its chilling suspense . for whatever the director's faults were , as for his politics being tainted with contradictions , he , at least , always considered his art above all else . it is filmed in a pleasant to look at tinted b/w .
rating:1 the plot is pure film noir , but the film's production values are even cheaper than the usual noir film . it is shot in a dull , shadowless manner and the performers seem to be lifeless except for milburn stone , who shines in a rare starring role for him . but it comes too late for anderson , who committed suicide just a little earlier . the plot was too convoluted to give the film credibility . but the film's premise was still interesting enough .
rating:2 the film makes it a point to show that the fictional region has its quota of local eccentrics , many of whom are related to one another . for the most part , the film is done in a campy way , balanced by veteran character actor ernie hudson playing his role seriously , taking offense at the racial slurs and showing that he's a powerful man , willing to take a strong stand for what he believes in . this is a very compelling story , aside from the weakness of claire's role , where she acts more campy than real . the film is most similar in racial tone to " to kill a mockingbird , " but is played more humorously and with less drive for its interracial sexual motives being the source for the crime .
rating:0 joseph ruben ( sleeping with the enemy/the stepfather/gorp/the good son ) has directed a lot of films that are just plain awful , as you could see from those mentioned above , except for the adequately made swte . he directed this predictable drama with a heavy hand as it lapses into melodramatics after a very emotionally moving start and after presenting a most interesting premise ; it is just too bad that the script had no conviction to follow through on its premise . the weakness of the film can be found in the director's lack of courage in understanding what a decision like this really entails to the person involved , and by making the film all about the anne heche character instead of focusing mainly on the two boys , as the film loses its sense of direction . by adding sidebars to the simple premise , it changes the question considerably and takes the edge off what decision is made . the director spoon feeds the answer that he thinks the audience wants , and it all seems to be a predictable formula driven film instead of one filled with a raw energy . after mid-film , any logical attempt at soul searching for what to do was lost in a series of obvious contrivances and clich ? s that were displeasing to watch . bad directors do such things to good ideas . heche is intense and persistent , not letting up on the less than eager sheriff to make such a commitment . here the story gets side-tracked for bad reasons . the only scene that made sense from this point on in the story , was the one where tony's fianc ? e ( vera ) asks some intelligent questions of the lawyer and fails to illicit responses that would make me want to go back . who in their right mind would unquestionably believe what beth is saying ? that is too easy a reason . heroes usually don't know if they are going to be heroes , they just do what is right at the moment . it is instinctual . in this case , from what i have seen of beth's direct confrontational approach , as difficult as it might be to say no , i think most people in tony's shoes would have no choice but refuse her request . at least , it does for tony . the scene of lewis in the malaysian jail , which is actually a jail cell in the philadelphia prison system , of him rambling on incoherently , complaining about the cell being godless , i thought , more than being good acting , smacked of melodrama and was not a very convincing portrayal of someone going over the edge ; but , it was scary . i just wonder how many would honestly go back to save lewis if they were in tony's shoes or in sheriff's shoes . i also wonder how good this film could have been in the hands of a fritz lang or even an elia kazan , or a modern director such as a martin scorsese . and that is the shame of this somber picture , it failed to move me and seemed to turn into a slight story , and this is after all its contrivances .
rating:3 his menacing sneers are unforgetable , adding spice to a feature that makes grand use of every shot taken , and for its very limited budget of $75 , 000 , equals in style and eloquence the highest budgeted films of that era . kubrick has created a sinister noir film , employing dark angle shots and a hand held camera , which is used effectively in the street scenes where he probably didn't have official permission to be filming . it is a surprisingly well-made film , especially considering its low-budget constraints and the very independent way it was produced . it is one of my favorite noir films ; it had something about it that i enjoyed that goes beyond its taut story and authencity , it reminded me so much of how the 1950s were a time of alienation and failed dreams for youngsters who were trying to capitalize on the boom times after ww11 .
rating:2 she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . it is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . this scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . but i doubt that . the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . the film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . the film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . julia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . this is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . and , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was !
rating:1 it has an exciting plot and is properly atmospheric despite its cheap studio sets . but , it seemed anti-climactic when compared to the tight story that preceeded it . the film had the mood of film noir , as milland is the innocent one who has no luck convincing society that he is indeed innocent . there is a sinister tone to the film that plays well . it's a scene that perfectly captures the chilling mood this thriller evoked .
rating:0 this film is tied together by four tired soap opera tales , that are competently-crafted but predictable . in my humble opinion , this film could have been made by using only one of the stories , instead of making them into roughly four- 40 minute segments , each with a title flashed on the screen to indicate the start of the new story . it is hard to believe that this film won more awards than any other mexican film ever has ! it makes you wonder about the quality of film that didn't win an award . it happens just like that ! it is the usual tear-jerker fare seen on those afternoon soap operas on american tv . on the plus side , the stories are intricately woven together so that they make sense . there is much humor in the telling of the stories and the acting is decent . otherwise , this plays mostly as glorified soap opera , with few surprises in all of its lengthy presentation .
rating:3 but the fireworks between the lovers is only beginning , as both feel betrayed and unsure of what to do . the magic in the film is in the chemical reaction between garfield and lana , their performances are sizzling . the reason the film is so provocative , is that it hits below the belt , where the lovers were most vulnerable . he has gone too far afield to evoke any sympathy for his plight .
rating:1 his predilection is for most of his heroes to be deformed or have suffered heavily at the hands of another . the simplistic plot can be seen from a mile away as to how it will develop and turn out . it exhibits the kind of racist outlook shown to the natives that movies will not allow today . what distinguishes this film , is the virtuoso performance of chaney as a villain , as he transforms himself into a fearsome character , and his expressive face keeps changing with his different moods . he could be tender and fatherly at one moment and the next moment he could have a menacing look . he also has a flare for wearing just the right makeup for the part he plays ; here he looks almost bald , giving him the extra chilling look he needed to have for the part . his speciality in the grotesque made him a silent star icon , someone who will not be forgotten , who could get the audience's attention by either inspiring them with the vulnerability of his character or by his morbid sense of getting into his character . the film is a strangely curious relic , not because of the story , but because he played this legless man so convincingly .
rating:1 a pleasant film that is not all that good as far as the crime caper story goes , but still has something about it that is endearing . it's in the tradition of hollywood films as escape vehicles , as it evokes a nostalgia for those kind of b-films that the studios used to routinely put out and were not that worried about the gaffes in the production . if you're a fan of the 1940s film noir , especially the classy billy wilder " double indemnity , " then you should find much in this latest woody allen comedy/mystery film to remind you of that film and others like it . woody sets this film in 1940 and catches with amazing accuracy the upholstered apartment furnishings , the lingo of the times , and the clothing worn and hairstyles . it was like watching one of those b-films , but instead of being in b & w this one is a lazy color version of it . it's the kind of faded out coloring that would have been used to make a 1940 film noir , if they were made in color . the retro scenes of all the interiors were exquisitely designed by santo loquasto and shot by zhao fei in mostly plum and gold colors that burnished on the screen . that's a home he made burglar-proof . admittedly this is all a thin and rather predictable story incorporating the usual woody nebbish sexist and egotististical character , and to make matters worse it comes with an unbelievable heist plot and with mechanical one-liners with silly double-entendre sexual meanings . it's a role that he's ritualized and could do it sleepwalking by now . but it worked for me because i didn't care about all that and instead got caught up with the film's casual look and the way it caught the look of the period's film noir , and i found the clash he had with helen hunt brought out the sides of his personality that he's battling within himself all his artistic life . woody seems more relaxed in this role than he has been in his more recent films . and , since the film has no artistic pretensions--it's more a homage to the b-films of the forties , it seemed easier to handle than some of his more recent ritualized woody-by-the-numbers flicks or those pale imitations of those european auteurs he so much admired like bergman--films he slavishly imitated that never worked for him . mind you , this is not a good film but one that can be viewed as an escape from reality . something that is not all that bad during these troubling economic days of that compassionate conservative administration of president bush . seeing this film made me forget for the moment about bush's war on stem cell research and the way he goes out of his way to please his extreme right-wing supporters and those big corporations that also supported him . the same purpose could be said of those early films in the forties , with the world being invaded by nazis . escape films were very much in vogue and served a purpose . i don't usually care for escape films , but every so often they feel right and can be enjoyable if you can really escape reality by watching them . those are the kinds of films i let my critical guard down on , and that's the case with this woody allen flick .
rating:1 what can i say about a film that was laugh-out-loud funny in spots , was driven by a fantastic performance by bruce willis as a contract killer , but was disturbingly vulgar ( the murder of an undercover cop is used as part of the comedy routine ) , except to say that it was driven by characters who seem to enjoy their work and working with each other . it was also a more palatable of a film than i thought it would be . these demented zany characters , not one of them who was without a blemished soul ( reminiscent of pulp fiction and analyze this ) , is a popular reworking of the gangster film into comedy , a phenomena of recent times worth taking note of in the gangster genre . the result is a film that gets over , more or less , as a parody . a film that is farcical and loopy , but leaves a lot to be desired . it still looks likes like a sitcom to me . the plot starts off simple and then becomes more complicated as more characters are introduced . she is disappointed that the likable oz can't make a good living out of his practice . he tells him he works for janni and after punching the dentist around offering some more excuses for sight gags and pratfalls , he brings him to see janni . the conversation from the heavily accented janni goes something like this , " i yust hate yimmy . the british born director jonathan lynn ( my cousin vinny ) , after a so-far mediocre career , has become more skilled at pacing a film , as the non-stop action scenes make the film fly by quickly , which might actually be its best asset . this is lighweight entertainment and should work well if one chooses to overlook a flawed script , questionable values , and that there are no nice people in the film . but . . . the film is funny .
rating:1 a cute family drama/comedy about destiny and the choices one makes . this indie film is set in chicago , comparing the protagonist's working-class background in the produce market with the high culture of the opera world he rejected . but . . . the george seems in a rut . . . not her managers have a divided opinion about giving george a shot at singing something spontaneously in her show , but she sides with giving him a chance , as she aims to make opera more accessible to the public and not to be only for the purists . the film ultimately is about whom does she love more -- the artist or the prominent politician . i bet you can guess who wins ! this was a likable but not a particularly moving tale . the characters were pleasing , but no more . the situation they were in seemed realistic , and the way they handled themselves gave the film its comedy sparks . but what the film was missing , was sparks from the romance . what the film also lacked was a more telling story and a bit more tension . it seemed to be played too loose and easy , as if the problems that come his way were part of the problems one would expect to find in any sitcom . nevertheless , i loved the atmosphere the film created -- of mixing the stock workingman types with the stock opera types , and with george cutting a nifty path to his destiny between his two chosen fields of endeavor . as for the opera singing -- let me shout from the rafters , bravo ! ! !
rating:2 kluger is perceived as being tougher and smarter than the d . a . the final shoot-out is well executed and though the story is as plain as vanilla , it still had plenty of tough action . felix e . feist directed this tough b&w noir film in a gritty and pleasing style .
rating:2 harry cohn , head of columbia pictures , gave joseph h . lewis his first break to make a classier picture than his previous low-budget ones , and when he saw the early rushes of the film , he elevated " my name is julia ross , " from a 10-day " b " to an 18-day " a " picture . though not original in motif , nevertheless this film is a beauty , one that is able through its visualizations to strike a fresh looking chord . it is noted for its brooding atmosphere , its classical noir camera work , as the heroine is seen forlornly looking out of windows with bars on them , and the film is particularly noteworthy for the fine performances of its stars , nina foch as julia ross , dame may whitty as mrs . hughes , and george macready as ralph hughes . ralph is a rather frightening character , often seen whittling intensely away with his knife . lewis comes up with a few interesting plot twists to make the story even more scary , as the trapped julia fights desperately to save her life , figuring her best chance , is to get word to dennis . the result is a pretty good suspense story and the beginning of lewis's illustrious career in directing a better type of a film .
rating:1 a so-so noir melodrama , that can't overcome its limited script and unbelievable premise of a career woman who gives it all up to live a boring life with the husband she's madly in love with . what keeps this melodrama going is the understated star performances generated by raymond burr and sterling hayden , bouncing off the fiercely passionate portrayal stanwyck gives . kathy gets involved in an outlandish situation , in many ways similar but a lot more deadly than those situations she used to make fun of when she wrote her lovelorn column . the best that can be said about this story , is that it's not bad and it had some sparks in it to keep you awake .
rating:2 a solid noir melodrama from vincent sherman , who takes a standard story and dresses it up with moving characterizations and beautifully expressionistic b&w photography from cinematographer james wong howe . the director took a songwriter paul webster's short magazine story called " the man who died twice " and improved the story by rounding out the characters to give them both strong and weak points , so that they would not be one-note characters as was the case in the original story . the movie posters said , 'if you were nora prentiss , would you keep your mouth shut ? ' the other famous quote from this film is 'a mouth like hers is just for kissing . . . not for telling ! ' the film proved to be popular with the public , especially with the women in the audience , and it turned out to be a big hit for ann sheridan . the glossy story might not be much on paper , but the telling of it was superb , showing how trapped the main characters became because of their lie .
rating:2 an old-fashioned coming-of-age story with a big heart ; " the cider house rules " is a slow-moving tale that builds on its characterizations and never waivers in the warmness of its story , no matter , even if somehow events turn sour . it is the kind of humanistic story hollywood can do very well , when it puts its mind to it , and in this production has done itself proud , making it the kind of film oscar is partial to . the one fly in the ointment , is its pro-choice emphasis , probably too controversial for hollywood to want to deal with , even if the director has gone out of his way to be evenhanded in presenting both sides of the issue in the film and so far no outcries from church groups against the film have materialized . the film took him 13 years in trying to get the project off the ground ; the result is a pleasingly sensitive narrative , avoiding anything too sugary . the only thing homer won't do , is abortions . the main theme of the film is that in your life it's most important " to be of use . " the rules that make the most sense , are the one's that are made by the party concerned , not by some outsider . the good doctor would be happy delivering babies and not doing abortions , if he thought that all the babies he delivered would be adopted . the only question he couldn't answer , probably because it is a question that can't be answered , is when homer says , " what if i were aborted ? that would mean i wouldn't have had a chance to live . " it reminded me of going to an animal shelter to adopt a dog and watching how they also make friendly gestures at their prospective owners . the point made , is that the children still want to go home to a family , despite this orphanage being such a kindly run place . the second part of the film involves the good-hearted , quiet and sincere homer , seeing life from a point of view away from the orphanage . swedish director lasse hallstr ? m ( my life as a dog/what's eating gilbert grape ? ) has made an articulate film , one that goes over territory such as abortion , incest , murder , and forging records , and asks the viewer to use their intelligence in seeing what is right or wrong . it is , at all times , a visually beautiful film . the children are heart-stoppers , and caine is simply brilliant in drawing them out . there is not one flawed scene in the story , in a story that has a few subplots that run parallel to its main motif . homer's insightful look at the world , is also the viewer's way of seeing things the way a child would , who hungers so much for honest affection and is striving to find his place in the world . the filmmaker has told a positive story , in a straight narrative style . the only failing in the film is that , maybe , the director walked too fine a line in regards to the subplot in the film , about the abortion issue , not making his motives absolutely clear , when it seems obvious where the film's heart lies , anyway . but , maybe the filmmaker wasn't clear enough in where the film's leanings were and answered it like a liberal republican engaged in a presidential primary might be forced to answer the question , in order not to scare the right- wing away from him . as for me , this is a beautiful and delicate film , that all but spells out its leanings for pro-choice being a practical answer to the controversial problem . yet some movie reviewers , including the esteemed roger ebert , the most widely read critic in america , find that the theme of the film is muddled . ebert is not sure what the point of the story is about , as it seems to arrive at no clear point of view , for his tastes . a response like that surprises me , because it is one thing to not like the film , but i can't see not liking it for that reason , since i found the direction the film was heading down to be very clear and i had no trouble with its showing how terrifying an ordeal an abortion could be , as it also showed how necessary it was not to leave an abortion in the the hands of someone with a coat-hanger , that it was a medical problem as much as it was an ethical problem and a decision that only the one with the pregnancy problem could decide whether it was the right or wrong thing to do . i couldn't see how the filmmaker could be clearer about what side of the fence the film was on . the story had a natural rhythm to it , and the relationship between caine and maguire wasn't contrived , but seemed to generate its own energy ; it seemed genuinely affecting . i felt very touched by the film and its ability to tell such a heartbreaking story in such a sensitive and intelligent manner , without it being an art house film .
