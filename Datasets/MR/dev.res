rating:0 an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .
rating:0 the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .
rating:1 an uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations .
rating:0 for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .
rating:0 hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes .
rating:1 drops you into a dizzying , volatile , pressure-cooker of a situation that quickly snowballs out of control , while focusing on the what much more than the why .
rating:0 bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .
rating:0 hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script . . . that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire .
rating:1 it's not particularly well made , but since i found myself howling more than cringing , i'd say the film works .
rating:0 even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd .
rating:0 the film's essentially over by the meet-cute .
rating:0 the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .
rating:0 to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .
rating:1 an ambitious movie that , like shiner's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that don't come off .
rating:0 while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .
rating:1 a film of quiet power .
rating:0 needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism .
rating:0 there isn't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .
rating:1 a moving and not infrequently breathtaking film .
rating:1 intimate and panoramic .
rating:1 psychologically savvy .
rating:1 the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff .
rating:1 stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid .
rating:0 there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject .
rating:0 what's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that's tv sitcom material at best .
rating:1 among the many pleasures are the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations .
rating:0 no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
rating:0 mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry .
rating:1 a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term .
rating:0 the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
rating:0 the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
rating:0 the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
rating:0 since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things .
rating:0 it all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time .
rating:1 true tale of courage -- and complicity -- at auschwitz is a harrowing drama that tries to tell of the unspeakable .
rating:1 a film in a class with spike lee's masterful do the right thing .
rating:1 winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic , achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars .
rating:0 a sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .
rating:0 by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .
rating:1 you needn't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of haynes' work . though haynes' style apes films from the period . . . its message is not rooted in that decade .
rating:0 the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay .
rating:0 ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous .
rating:0 adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .
rating:0 too much power , not enough puff .
rating:0 a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided .
rating:1 novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach .
rating:1 there has always been something likable about the marquis de sade .
rating:1 an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great ‘what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances
rating:0 it's not hateful . it's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .
rating:0 how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?
rating:1 a fast paced and suspenseful argentinian thriller about the shadow side of play .
rating:0 nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them .
rating:0 it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .
rating:0 for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league .
rating:1 it says a lot about a filmmaker when he can be wacky without clobbering the audience over the head and still maintain a sense of urgency and suspense .
rating:0 the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .
rating:0 too silly to take seriously .
rating:0 i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me .
rating:1 this odd , distant portuguese import more or less borrows from bad lieutenant and les vampires , and comes up with a kind of art-house gay porn film .
rating:0 any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes .
rating:0 it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .
rating:0 the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
rating:1 a compelling pre-wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message .
rating:1 with lesser talents , high crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable . with freeman and judd , i'll at least remember their characters .
rating:1 does point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets .
rating:0 lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .
rating:0 maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back .
rating:0 the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much .
rating:1 a dazzling dream of a documentary .
rating:1 the ya-ya's have many secrets and one is - the books are better . translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be ya-ya .
rating:0 it's a long way from orwell's dark , intelligent warning cry [1984] to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation .
rating:0 no movement , no yuks , not much of anything .
rating:0 a noble failure .
rating:1 the rare imax movie that you'll wish was longer than an hour .
rating:1 a delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional .
rating:0 the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly .
rating:0 hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound .
rating:1 begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish .
rating:0 it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
rating:1 a dashing and absorbing outing with one of france's most inventive directors .
rating:0 doesn't add up to much .
rating:0 one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .
rating:0 the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .
rating:0 the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine .
rating:1 scherfig's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky .
rating:0 this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
rating:0 the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
rating:1 a highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world .
rating:0 what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes .
rating:1 visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it's the very definition of epic adventure .
rating:1 fans of the modern day hong kong action film finally have the worthy successor to a better tomorrow and the killer which they have been patiently waiting for .
rating:0 an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story .
rating:0 even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat .
rating:1 i was impressed by how many tit-for-tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an american-russian armageddon .
rating:1 moore's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that's still very much playing itself out .
rating:0 with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails .
rating:1 although melodramatic and predictable , this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five filipino-americans and their frantic efforts to find love .
rating:0 passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless .
rating:1 a solidly seaworthy chiller .
rating:0 in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .
rating:0 if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother .
rating:0 velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film'' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene .
rating:0 if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four- minute egg .
rating:0 neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .
rating:0 [sam's] self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining .
rating:1 if the first men in black was money , the second is small change . but it still jingles in the pocket . it's fun lite .
rating:0 it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .
rating:0 you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production .
rating:0 manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .
rating:0 starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill .
rating:0 feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake .
rating:0 in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
rating:1 perhaps the best sports movie i've ever seen .
rating:1 as simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine . this is a movie you can trust .
rating:1 passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone .
rating:0 make like the title and dodge this one .
rating:1 a genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives .
rating:0 ver wiel's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless .
rating:1 spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it , but " spider-man " certainly delivers the goods .
rating:0 davis has energy , but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly .
rating:0 . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
rating:1 the year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but take care of my cat emerges as the very best of them .
rating:0 one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .
rating:0 even with harris's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown .
rating:1 the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view .
rating:1 apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen .
rating:0 attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .
rating:0 one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .
rating:1 a lot of fun , with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers .
rating:0 " analyze that " is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original .
rating:0 gere gives a good performance in a film that doesn't merit it .
rating:0 possibly not since grumpy old men have i heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another .
rating:1 the success of undercover brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally .
rating:1 the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la
rating:0 my precious new star wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag . . .
rating:0 give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there's nothing here that they couldn't have done in half an hour .
rating:0 no way i can believe this load of junk .
rating:1 i'm not a fan of the phrase 'life affirming' because it usually means 'schmaltzy , ' but real women have curves truly is life affirming .
rating:1 hoffman's performance is authentic to the core of his being .
rating:0 seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight .
rating:0 sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard .
rating:0 rashomon-for-dipsticks tale .
rating:0 the story . . . is moldy and obvious .
rating:0 with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm .
rating:1 this comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative .
rating:1 sayles is making a statement about the inability of dreams and aspirations to carry forward into the next generation .
rating:1 " the ring " is pretty much an english-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws .
rating:1 it's a fun adventure movie for kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure .
rating:0 [sen's] soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions .
rating:1 one-of-a-kind near-masterpiece .
rating:1 old people will love this movie , and i mean that in the nicest possible way : last orders will touch the heart of anyone old enough to have earned a 50-year friendship .
rating:0 the film's center will not hold .
rating:0 for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer .
rating:1 adaptation is simply brilliant .
rating:1 red dragon makes one appreciate silence of the lambs .
rating:1 the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on büttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history .
rating:1 a fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the new age .
rating:0 a fifty car pileup of cliches .
rating:1 more good than great but freeman and judd make it work .
rating:1 has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke .
rating:1 with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , hélène angel is definitely a director to watch .
rating:0 the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere .
rating:1 gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife .
rating:0 does paint some memorable images . . . , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
rating:0 well-meant but unoriginal .
rating:1 it's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism .
rating:1 not as good as the full monty , but a really strong second effort .
rating:0 it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .
rating:1 this is pretty dicey material . but some unexpected zigs and zags help .
rating:0 take away the controversy , and it's not much more watchable than a mexican soap opera .
rating:0 the chocolate factory without charlie .
rating:0 …passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road .
rating:0 the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler .
rating:1 the modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases
rating:1 a highly intriguing thriller , coupled with some ingenious plot devices and some lavishly built settings . . it's a worthwhile tutorial in quantum physics and slash-dash
rating:1 so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor .
rating:0 shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about
rating:1 a remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point .
rating:1 a meatier deeper beginning and/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the " a " range , as is , it's a very very strong " b+ . " i love the robust middle of this picture .
rating:1 a thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one's actions .
rating:0 a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .
rating:0 [i]f you've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you've already seen this kind of thing .
rating:0 it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .
rating:0 there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route .
rating:0 the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .
rating:0 i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation .
rating:1 anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film .
rating:0 a little too pat for its own good .
rating:0 just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .
rating:0 shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
rating:1 it's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen .
rating:0 feels less like a change in [herzog's] personal policy than a half-hearted fluke .
rating:0 what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad .
rating:1 there's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career , if they want one .
rating:1 in adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns .
rating:0 the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief .
rating:0 ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ?
rating:0 swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .
rating:0 the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .
rating:0 the country bears wastes an exceptionally good idea . but the movie that doesn't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
rating:1 the most wondrous love story in years , it is a great film .
rating:0 cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy .
rating:1 bittersweet comedy/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable italian guys .
rating:1 a typically observant , carefully nuanced and intimate french coming-of-age film that is an encouraging debut feature but has a needlessly downbeat ending that is too heavy for all that has preceded it .
rating:0 squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .
rating:0 an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .
rating:1 a journey through memory , a celebration of living , and a sobering rumination on fatality , classism , and ignorance .
rating:0 another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh .
rating:1 fudges fact and fancy with such confidence that we feel as if we're seeing something purer than the real thing .
rating:0 narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess .
rating:0 herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance .
rating:1 one of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society .
rating:0 a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese .
rating:1 it's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works .
rating:1 what time is it there ? is not easy . it haunts you , you can't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it .
rating:0 apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .
rating:1 handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy .
rating:1 in my opinion , analyze that is not as funny or entertaining as analyze this , but it is a respectable sequel .
rating:1 often hilarious .
rating:0 it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn .
rating:1 blithely anachronistic and slyly achronological .
rating:0 the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
rating:0 unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you're going to feel like you weren't invited to the party .
rating:1 the film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task .
rating:1 confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of barris' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture .
rating:1 schnitzler does a fine job contrasting the sleekness of the film's present with the playful paranoia of the film's past .
rating:1 graced with the kind of social texture and realism that would be foreign in american teen comedies .
rating:0 this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .
rating:0 after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music .
rating:1 godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence .
rating:0 the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they don't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand , either .
rating:1 the chateau belongs to rudd , whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting french malapropisms . . . is a nonstop hoot .
rating:1 dolgin and franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a vietnamese-born youngster who eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-american girl with a brand new name in southern tennessee .
rating:1 earns its laughs from stock redneck 'types' and from the many , many moments when we recognize even without the elizabethan prose , the play behind the thing .
rating:0 very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
rating:0 this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .
rating:0 simply doesn't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time .
rating:0 cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke .
rating:0 better to just call it abc kiarostami . for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery .
rating:0 here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .
rating:1 soderbergh , like kubrick before him , may not touch the planet's skin , but understands the workings of its spirit .
rating:0 marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue .
rating:1 takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights .
rating:0 i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .
rating:1 the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath . . .
rating:0 the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i can't remember a single name responsible for it .
rating:0 if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
rating:0 the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest .
rating:1 a fascinating , bombshell documentary that should shame americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with kissinger . should be required viewing for civics classes and would-be public servants alike .
rating:0 gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic .
rating:1 . . . " bowling for columbine " remains a disquieting and thought-provoking film . . .
rating:0 a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .
rating:0 an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product .
rating:0 director clare kilner's debut is never as daft as it should have been .
rating:1 visits spy-movie territory like a novel you can't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last .
rating:1 the most amazing super-sized dosage of goofball stunts any " jackass " fan could want .
rating:1 despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show . . . represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it .
rating:0 oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .
rating:0 godawful boring slug of a movie .
rating:0 potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .
rating:0 partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show .
rating:1 if you're a fan of the series you'll love it and probably want to see it twice . i will be .
rating:0 egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose .
rating:0 too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization .
rating:0 an ugly , revolting movie .
rating:1 an entertaining documentary that freshly considers arguments the bard's immortal plays were written by somebody else .
rating:1 because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before .
rating:0 de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back .
rating:1 doug liman , the director of bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses damon's ability to be focused and sincere .
rating:0 . . . too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film .
rating:0 not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies .
rating:0 . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic .
rating:1 the story may not be new , but australian director john polson , making his american feature debut , jazzes it up adroitly .

rating:1 it's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 .

rating:1 cox creates a fluid and mesmerizing sequence of images to match the words of nijinsky's diaries .

rating:0 plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .
rating:0 mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service .

rating:1 a solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy .
rating:1 whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck .

rating:1 . . . while dark water isn't a complete wash ( no pun intended ) , watched side-by-side with ringu , it ultimately comes off as a pale successor .
rating:0 not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .

rating:0 home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice .
rating:0 the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes .
