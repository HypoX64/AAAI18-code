rating:1 there are some movies that hit you from the first scene and you know it's going to be a trip . igby goes down is one of those movies .
rating:0 the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr . deeds was to that of frank capra .

rating:0 the film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch christian right propaganda machine into national media circles .
rating:0 the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .

rating:1 vincent gallo is right at home in this french shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role .
rating:0 despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela .
rating:1 it's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but westbrook's foundation and dalrymple's film earn their uplift .
rating:1 amari has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances .
rating:1 a whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking christian-themed fun .
rating:1 delirious fun .
rating:0 deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going .
rating:1 zhang yimou delivers warm , genuine characters who lie not through dishonesty , but because they genuinely believe it's the only way to bring happiness to their loved ones .
rating:0 reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness .
rating:0 despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end .
rating:0 as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .
rating:1 a worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions .
rating:1 a funny , triumphant , and moving documentary .
rating:1 'tobey maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation . '
rating:0 execrable .
rating:1 preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment .
rating:1 it's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth .
rating:1 'interesante y disfrutable trabajo gracias a que prescinde del clásico elemento estadounidense patriotero y manipulador . '
rating:0 cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .
rating:0 this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted .
rating:1 too often , son of the bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained " big moment " will occur and not " if . "
rating:1 it's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today .
rating:1 the screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him . . . there is never really a true " us " versus " them " .
rating:1 a mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last .
rating:1 a " black austin powers ? " i prefer to think of it as " pootie tang with a budget . " sa da tay !
rating:0 this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow .
rating:0 eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation .
rating:0 i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again .
rating:1 the pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze .
rating:1 exciting documentary .
rating:0 you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .
rating:1 combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- why didn't hollywood think of this sooner ?
rating:0 it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .
rating:1 chalk it up to my adoration for both de niro and murphy , but i had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws .
rating:1 twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record .
rating:0 the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie .
rating:0 the script by vincent r . nebrida . . . tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot .
rating:0 the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
rating:0 plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .
rating:1 has an unmistakable , easy joie de vivre .
rating:0 you're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous .
rating:1 it's all about anakin . . . and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect .
rating:1 the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture . much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride .
rating:1 a sweet , tender sermon about a 12-year-old welsh boy more curious about god than girls , who learns that believing in something does matter .
rating:0 to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .
rating:0 the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
rating:0 bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be .
rating:0 sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and judaism back at least 50 .
rating:0 if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .
rating:1 " frailty " has been written so well , that even a simple " goddammit ! " near the end takes on a whole other meaning .
rating:0 gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story .
rating:1 the production values are of the highest and the performances attractive without being memorable .
rating:1 my little eye is the best little " horror " movie i've seen in years .
rating:0 basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars .
rating:0 lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else .
rating:0 director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .
rating:1 a stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of beauty and the beast and 1930s horror films
rating:1 beautifully directed and convincingly acted .
rating:1 no sophomore slump for director sam mendes , who segues from oscar winner to oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand .
rating:0 it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .
rating:0 no better or worse than 'truth or consequences , n . m . ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater .
rating:0 it tells more than it shows .
rating:0 this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .
rating:1 what makes salton sea surprisingly engrossing is that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion .
rating:0 to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree .
rating:1 those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they don't really want to know .
rating:1 over the years , hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and ice age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor .
rating:1 a flick about our infantilized culture that isn't entirely infantile .
rating:0 this isn't a " friday " worth waiting for .
rating:1 if you're down for a silly hack-and-slash flick , you can do no wrong with jason x .
rating:0 arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie .
rating:1 the chateau is a risky venture that never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy .
rating:0 if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation .
rating:1 worth watching for dong jie's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change .
rating:1 a gentle and engrossing character study .
rating:0 a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties .
rating:0 the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .
rating:0 an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .
rating:0 i got a headache watching this meaningless downer .
rating:1 a rarity among recent iranian films : it's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist's plight .
rating:0 the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .
rating:1 if i have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story ( like , say , treasure planet ) or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , i'll take the latter every time .
rating:0 viewers of barney's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it .
rating:0 when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart .
rating:1 either a fascinating study of the relationship between mothers and their children or a disturbing story about sociopaths and their marks .
rating:1 saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory .
rating:0 the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments .
rating:1 a quirky comedy set in newfoundland that cleverly captures the dry wit that's so prevalent on the rock .
rating:0 i don't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but don't treat me like a fool .
rating:1 a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , read my lips is an original . this is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent .
rating:1 antwone fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories but , with few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it .
rating:0 will no doubt delight plympton's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting .
rating:1 a story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously . it is also beautifully acted .
rating:1 upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that doesn't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them .
rating:1 the am-radio soundtrack and game cast -- tierney and the inimitable walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit .
rating:0 opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
rating:0 sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life .
rating:1 smith's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes .
rating:1 the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question . but this time there's some mold on the gold .
rating:1 full of detail about the man and his country , and is well worth seeing .
rating:0 clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
rating:1 the film belongs to the marvelous verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public
rating:1 miyazaki is one of world cinema's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers .
rating:0 with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable " formula 51 " is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .
rating:1 a biopic about crane's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video .
rating:1 [reynolds] takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch .
rating:0 it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .
rating:0 almost gags on its own gore .
rating:0 there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .
rating:1 it's a talking head documentary , but a great one .
rating:1 quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor .
rating:0 oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .
rating:0 tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span .
rating:1 a poignant lyricism runs through balzac and the little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem .
rating:0 julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan .
rating:1 ozpetek joins the ranks of those gay filmmakers who have used the emigre experience to explore same-sex culture in ways that elude the more nationally settled .
rating:1 woo's fights have a distinct flair . his warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos .
rating:1 offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication .
rating:0 despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .
rating:0 as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink .
rating:0 pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle .
rating:0 pompous and garbled .
rating:1 one of the best inside-show-biz yarns ever .
rating:0 an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas .
rating:1 like many western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about north korea's recent past and south korea's future adds a much needed moral weight .
rating:1 a melancholy , emotional film .
rating:1 thurman and lewis are hilarious throughout .
rating:1 what makes how i killed my father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is fontaine's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching .
rating:0 if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate .
rating:1 starts slowly , but adrien brody – in the title role – helps make the film's conclusion powerful and satisfying .
rating:0 human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control .
rating:1 the film's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen .
rating:1 fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn .
rating:0 christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire .
rating:0 a gushy episode of " m * a * s * h " only this time from an asian perspective .
rating:0 these two are generating about as much chemistry as an iraqi factory poised to receive a un inspector .
rating:0 4ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as pokemon videos , but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly .
rating:0 while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness .
rating:0 the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly… alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown .
rating:0 wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste .
rating:0 not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs .
rating:1 too much of storytelling moves away from solondz's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur's professional injuries .
rating:0 the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects .
rating:0 the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .
rating:1 an old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale of the kind they rarely make anymore .
rating:1 this cuddly sequel to the 1999 hit is a little more visually polished , a little funnier , and a little more madcap .
rating:0 with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low .
rating:0 most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .
rating:0 it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows .
rating:0 occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .
rating:0 when the precise nature of matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up .
rating:0 it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy !
rating:0 behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise !
rating:1 a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide .
rating:1 vereté has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs .
rating:0 for all its brilliant touches , dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion .
rating:1 an undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that's what makes it worth a recommendation .
rating:1 the film's unhurried pace is actually one of its strengths . entirely appropriately , the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn .
rating:1 works because we're never sure if ohlinger's on the level or merely a dying , delusional man trying to get into the history books before he croaks .
rating:0 it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving .
rating:0 though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .
rating:0 deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .
rating:0 morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he's taken one of the world's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating .
rating:1 what makes the movie a comedy is the way it avoids the more serious emotions involved .
rating:0 the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .
rating:1 the film is a very good viewing alternative for young women .
rating:1 mike white's deft combination of serious subject matter and dark , funny humor make " " the good girl " a film worth watching .
rating:1 dark and disturbing , but also surprisingly funny .
rating:0 [less a movie than] an appalling , odoriferous thing . . . so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you'll want to crawl up your own * * * in embarrassment .
rating:0 it's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time .
rating:0 ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would .
rating:1 who knows what exactly godard is on about in this film , but his words and images don't have to add up to mesmerize you .
rating:0 an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship .
rating:1 i admired this work a lot .
rating:1 here's a british flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility , yet just as determined to entertain you .
rating:1 it's a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told , with superb performances throughout .
rating:1 an awfully good , achingly human picture .
rating:0 dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ?
rating:1 a sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that isn't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears .
rating:0 exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair .
rating:1 the cast . . . keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired .
rating:1 tadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother .
rating:0 the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .
rating:0 you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz .
rating:1 a compelling french psychological drama examining the encounter of an aloof father and his chilly son after 20 years apart .
rating:1 count on his movie to work at the back of your neck long after you leave the theater .
rating:0 every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming .
rating:0 kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world .
rating:0 buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block .
rating:0 feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
rating:0 whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it's an unhappy situation all around .
rating:1 a fascinating documentary that provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system
rating:1 this movie got me grinning . there's a part of us that cannot help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something .
rating:0 lucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it's also drab and inert .
rating:0 consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire .
rating:0 why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?
rating:1 smart and alert , thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem .
rating:1 hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation .
rating:1 it's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer .
rating:0 . . . bibbidy-bobbidi-bland .
rating:0 the fourth in a series that i'll bet most parents had thought --hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished .
rating:0 so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
rating:1 terrific as nadia , a russian mail-order bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english , it's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers .
rating:1 chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them .
rating:1 a thinly veiled look at different aspects of chinese life clashing with each other .
rating:0 the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies .
rating:0 interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots .
rating:0 outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .
rating:1 the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms . ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh's book trainspotting .
rating:1 hardly a film that comes along every day .
rating:0 " the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store "
rating:0 chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it's . . . like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror .
rating:1 provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views .
rating:0 none of birthday girl's calculated events take us by surprise . . .
rating:1 corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless . it's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain . at all .
rating:0 it's got the brawn , but not the brains .
rating:1 duvall is strong as always .
rating:1 the film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery .
rating:0 collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly .
rating:0 a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture .
rating:1 white oleander may leave you rolling your eyes in the dark , but that doesn't mean you won't like looking at it .
rating:0 crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .
rating:1 plays out with a dogged and eventually winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel .
rating:0 while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor .
rating:1 foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling .
rating:1 the importance of being earnest , so thick with wit it plays like a reading from bartlett's familiar quotations
rating:0 sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely .
rating:1 skip work to see it at the first opportunity .
rating:0 [at least] moore is a real charmer .
rating:0 i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .
rating:1 nair's cast is so large it's altman-esque , but she deftly spins the multiple stories in a vibrant and intoxicating fashion .
rating:1 leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time .
rating:1 contradicts everything we've come to expect from movies nowadays . instead of simply handling conventional material in a conventional way , secretary takes the most unexpected material and handles it in the most unexpected way .
rating:0 the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy .
rating:1 angel presents events partly from the perspective of aurelie and christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale .
rating:1 your response to its new sequel , analyze that , may hinge on what you thought of the first film .
rating:0 yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents .
rating:1 the magic ( and original running time ) of ace japanimator hayao miyazaki's spirited away survives intact in bv's re-voiced version .
rating:0 the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .
rating:1 the reason to see " sade " lay with the chemistry and complex relationship between the marquis ( auteil ) and emilie ( le besco ) .
rating:0 you can practically smell the patchouli oil .
rating:0 there's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme .
rating:1 texan director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare .
rating:0 the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project .
rating:0 dilbert without the right-on satiric humor .
rating:0 as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
rating:1 it's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast .
rating:1 cq's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best european directors .
rating:1 in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters — damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .
rating:0 the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .
rating:1 insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion . but the performances of pacino , williams , and swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through .
rating:0 mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values .
rating:0 holden caulfield did it better .
rating:1 what bubbles up out of john c . walsh's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch .
rating:0 a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .
rating:0 die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with .
rating:1 one of the most exciting action films to come out of china in recent years .
rating:0 the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .
rating:1 the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances .
rating:1 witless but watchable .
rating:1 romanek's themes are every bit as distinctive as his visuals . beyond the cleverness , the weirdness and the pristine camerawork , one hour photo is a sobering meditation on why we take pictures .
rating:0 seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors .
rating:0 a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .
rating:1 an enthralling aesthetic experience , one that's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty .
rating:1 as a director , paxton is surprisingly brilliant , deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip .
rating:0 debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish .
rating:0 being unique doesn't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke .
rating:1 american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone .
rating:0 i'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap cliché .
rating:0 despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .
rating:0 if the movie were all comedy , it might work better . but it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness .
rating:1 there has to be a few advantages to never growing old . like being able to hit on a 15-year old when you're over 100 .
rating:1 that the film opens with maggots crawling on a dead dog is not an out of place metaphor .
rating:0 whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary .
rating:1 merci pour le movie .
rating:1 a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture .
rating:1 a richly imagined and admirably mature work from a gifted director who definitely has something on his mind .
rating:0 adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some .
rating:1 triple x is a double agent , and he's one bad dude . when you've got the wildly popular vin diesel in the equation , it adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed .
rating:0 they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .
rating:1 …an adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle .
rating:0 it looks good , but it is essentially empty .
rating:0 has its charming quirks and its dull spots .
rating:1 beautifully crafted and brutally honest , promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the middle east struggle and into the humanity of its people .
rating:0 some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .
rating:0 if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .
rating:0 as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear .
rating:0 an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort .
rating:1 generates an enormous feeling of empathy for its characters .
rating:0 never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful .
rating:1 as action-adventure , this space-based homage to robert louis stevenson's treasure island fires on all plasma conduits .
rating:0 the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds .
rating:0 what more can be expected from a college comedy that's target audience hasn't graduated from junior high school ?
rating:1 will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year .
rating:1 vera's three actors -- mollà , gil and bardem -- excel in insightful , empathetic performances .
rating:0 woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ?
rating:1 in a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the discovery channel . but in imax 3-d , the clichés disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography .
rating:1 sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling . and in this regard , on guard delivers .
rating:0 far too clever by half , howard's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .
rating:1 macdowell . . . gives give a solid , anguished performance that eclipses nearly everything else she's ever done .
rating:0 literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes .
rating:1 the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together .
rating:1 what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors .
rating:0 the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .
rating:0 it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than " confessions of a dangerous mind . "
rating:1 the film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence .
rating:1 you never know where changing lanes is going to take you but it's a heck of a ride . samuel l . jackson is one of the best actors there is .
rating:0 loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .
rating:0 `martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .
rating:0 if disney's cinderella proved that 'a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio's wallet makes .
rating:0 it's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny , and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed .
rating:1 a canny , derivative , wildly gruesome portrait of a london sociopath who's the scariest of sadists .
rating:1 displaying about equal amounts of naiveté , passion and talent , beneath clouds establishes sen as a filmmaker of considerable potential .
rating:0 bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers .
rating:0 those who are only mildly curious , i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals .
rating:0 in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context .
rating:0 fairly run-of-the-mill .
rating:0 adam sandler's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
rating:1 whatever complaints i might have , i'd take [its] earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor's club any time .
rating:1 despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience .
rating:1 this is an extraordinary film , not least because it is japanese and yet feels universal .
rating:0 the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died .
rating:1 frida isn't that much different from many a hollywood romance . what sets it apart is the vision that taymor , the avant garde director of broadway's the lion king and the film titus , brings .
rating:1 bill morrison's decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful .
rating:1 [fincher's] camera sense and assured pacing make it an above-average thriller .
rating:0 the characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .
rating:0 the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .
rating:0 alternately frustrating and rewarding .
rating:1 for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded .
rating:1 oh , james ! your 20th outing shows off a lot of stamina and vitality , and get this , madonna's cameo doesn't suck !
rating:0 if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?
rating:1 it deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons .
rating:0 the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming .
rating:1 . . . in no way original , or even all that memorable , but as downtown saturday matinee brain candy , it doesn't disappoint .
rating:1 helps to remind the first world that hiv/aids is far from being yesterday's news .
rating:0 . . . a bland , pretentious mess .
rating:1 jagger the actor is someone you want to see again .
rating:0 an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he'd gone the way of don simpson .
rating:1 even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many , although in reality they are not enough . every child's story is what matters . this film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost .
rating:1 for anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man's response to stroke , ram dass : fierce grace is worth seeking out .
rating:0 a glossy knock-off of a b-movie revenge flick .
rating:1 son of the bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness .
rating:1 ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum .
rating:0 i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr . holland's class for the music , or to robin williams's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve .
rating:0 while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points .
rating:1 unpretentious , charming , quirky , original
rating:0 there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .
rating:0 it's exactly what you'd expect .
rating:1 andersson creates a world that's at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ; absurd , yet tremendously sad .
rating:0 overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
rating:0 i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .
rating:1 a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation .
rating:0 the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .
rating:0 content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .
rating:0 this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .
rating:0 the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .
rating:1 if you're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you're at the right film .
rating:0 [t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent .
rating:0 like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions .
rating:1 one of the funniest motion pictures of the year , but . . . also one of the most curiously depressing .
rating:1 emerges as something rare , an issue movie that's so honest and keenly observed that it doesn't feel like one .
rating:1 k 19 stays afloat as decent drama/action flick
rating:1 subversive , meditative , clinical and poetic , the piano teacher is a daring work of genius .
rating:0 even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .
rating:1 a bright , inventive , thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy .
rating:1 an eye-boggling blend of psychedelic devices , special effects and backgrounds , 'spy kids 2' is a visual treat for all audiences .
rating:0 this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic .
rating:1 to call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest .
rating:0 essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . .
rating:1 a movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart .
rating:1 ahhhh . . . revenge is sweet !
rating:1 travels a fascinating arc from hope and euphoria to reality and disillusionment .
rating:0 it's easy to love robin tunney -- she's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices .
rating:0 amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn .
rating:0 every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife .
rating:0 . . . has virtually no script at all . . .
rating:1 it was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at .
rating:0 i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year .
rating:1 though nijinsky's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature .
rating:0 afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen's men is finally just one long drag .
rating:1 if this movie were a book , it would be a page-turner , you can't wait to see what happens next .
rating:1 this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year !
rating:1 'easily my choice for one of the year's best films . '
rating:0 there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version .
rating:1 a journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist -- yet it's potentially just as rewarding .
rating:1 maybe thomas wolfe was right : you can't go home again .
rating:0 it's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance .
rating:0 donovan . . . squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences .
rating:1 É uma pena que , mais tarde , o próprio filme abandone o tom de paródia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clichês que havia satirizado .
rating:1 hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic .
rating:1 " its successes are also tempered with elements which prove the direct antithesis of what it gets right . "
rating:0 . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen .
rating:1 it will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days .
rating:1 affable if not timeless , like mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids .
rating:1 jeong-hyang lee's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying .
rating:0 manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane .
rating:0 the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate .
rating:0 vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them .
rating:0 this film biggest problem ? no laughs .
rating:1 coppola's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that , despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development , still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema .
rating:0 the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
rating:0 this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand .
rating:1 whether [binoche and magimel] are being charming or angst-ridden , they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria .
rating:0 i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort .
rating:0 is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ?
rating:0 . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises .
rating:1 maud and roland's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but labute pulls off a neater trick in possession : he makes language sexy .
rating:0 the director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff .
rating:0 kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both .
rating:0 attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .
rating:0 . . . delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation and simplistic story .
rating:1 this film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities .
rating:0 the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting .
rating:0 theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues .
rating:1 everywhere the camera looks there is something worth seeing .
rating:0 they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .
rating:0 rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign .
rating:1 a wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture .
rating:0 nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career .
rating:0 glizty but formulaic and silly . . . cagney's 'top of the world' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel .
rating:1 nervy and sensitive , it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives hollywood .
rating:1 as lo-fi as the special effects are , the folks who cobbled nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that george lucas has long forgotten .
rating:0 with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s .
rating:1 this is not chabrol's best , but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer .
rating:0 instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence .
rating:1 beating the austin powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness .
rating:0 there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
rating:0 just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit .
rating:1 . . . breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters .
rating:1 it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back .
rating:1 quitting delivers a sucker-punch , and its impact is all the greater beause director zhang's last film , the cuddly shower , was a non-threatening multi-character piece centered around a public bath house .
rating:1 the movie is full of fine performances , led by josef bierbichler as brecht and monica bleibtreu as helene weigel , his wife .
rating:1 this is as respectful a film as byatt fans could hope for , though lovers of the book may wonder why it's necessary .
rating:1 without heavy-handedness , dong provides perspective with his intelligent grasp of human foibles and contradictions .
rating:1 craig bartlett and director tuck tucker should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters .
rating:0 well-made but mush-hearted .
rating:0 too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .
rating:0 an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting .
rating:1 if you're willing to have fun with it , you won't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful .
rating:1 mazel tov to a film about a family's joyous life acting on the yiddish stage .
rating:1 much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive .
rating:0 if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .
rating:0 the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau .
rating:1 takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms .
rating:1 this fascinating look at israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful .
rating:0 what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?
rating:1 like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well .
rating:1 it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness .
rating:1 haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration .
rating:0 such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .
rating:0 the story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare , and the romance with ryder is puzzling .
rating:0 what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .
rating:0 an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we've been watching for decades
rating:0 enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting .
rating:0 why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?
rating:0 credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
rating:1 it's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill . naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation .
rating:0 it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .
rating:1 a film of delicate interpersonal dances . caine makes us watch as his character awakens to the notion that to be human is eventually to have to choose . it's a sight to behold .
rating:0 director david fincher and writer david koepp can't sustain it .
rating:0 frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes .
rating:0 lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and doesn't know how to have fun .
rating:1 a spiffy animated feature about an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth .
rating:0 frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for .
rating:0 at best , cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience .
rating:0 the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel isn't the actor to save it .
rating:1 the movie , despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places , is wry and engrossing .
rating:0 the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .
rating:0 all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .
rating:0 the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .
rating:0 while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
rating:0 the film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go .
rating:1 sweet home alabama " is what it is – a nice , harmless date film . . .
rating:1 an inuit masterpiece that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love , communal discord , and justice unfolds .
rating:1 though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation .
rating:1 the diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time .
rating:0 and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> .
rating:0 it was a dark and stormy night . . .
rating:1 impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises .
rating:0 visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying .
rating:1 a mess when it comes to the characters and writing . . . but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory .
rating:0 for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .
rating:0 even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series .
rating:1 one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning .
rating:1 the spaniel-eyed jean reno infuses hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart .
rating:1 a flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds .
rating:1 a cartoon that's truly cinematic in scope , and a story that's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big , four-legged herbivore .
rating:1 a violent initiation rite for the audience , as much as it is for angelique , the [opening] dance guarantees karmen's enthronement among the cinema's memorable women .
rating:1 effective in all its aspects , margarita happy hour represents an auspicious feature debut for chaiken .
rating:0 sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .
rating:1 it's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart .
rating:0 it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .
rating:0 by turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy .
rating:1 a burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at .
rating:1 brave and sweetly rendered love story .
rating:0 with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry's boss , there isn't a redeeming moment here .
rating:1 what saves this deeply affecting film from being merely a collection of wrenching cases is corcuera's attention to detail .
rating:1 the film occasionally tries the viewer's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story .
rating:0 to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion .
rating:1 smart , provocative and blisteringly funny .
rating:1 it's . . . worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts .
rating:1 features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer's block ever .
rating:1 a well-executed spy-thriller .
rating:1 . . . could easily be called the best korean film of 2002 .
rating:1 romantic , riveting and handsomely animated .
rating:1 the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies .
rating:1 because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by kieran culkin .
rating:0 utter mush . . . conceited pap .
rating:1 based on a devilishly witty script by heather mcgowan and niels mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters
rating:0 a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor .
rating:1 chicago pode até ser um filme divertido e cativante ( como é ) , mas acaba representando um passo que vai na direção contrária à evolução dos musicais .
rating:1 sensitive ensemble performances and good period reconstruction add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments .
rating:0 a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .
rating:0 a film with a great premise but only a great premise .
rating:1 sturdy , entertaining period drama . . . both caine and fraser have their moments .
rating:1 [broomfield] uncovers a story powerful enough to leave the screen sizzling with intrigue .
rating:0 . . . irritating soul-searching garbage .
rating:1 efficient , suitably anonymous chiller .
rating:0 could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? in a word -- yes .
rating:1 leigh isn't breaking new ground , but he knows how a daily grind can kill love .
rating:1 a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship .
rating:1 this is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory , and in spite of numerous minor flaws , scorsese's best in more than a decade .
rating:1 the wonderful combination of the sweetness and the extraordinary technical accomplishments of the first film are maintained , but its overall impact falls a little flat with a storyline that never quite delivers the original magic .
rating:0 . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet .
rating:1 a powerful , chilling , and affecting study of one man's dying fall .
rating:0 if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .
rating:1 a taut , intelligent psychological drama .
rating:0 follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun .
rating:0 adam sandler's eight crazy nights grows on you -- like a rash .
rating:1 shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski's the pianist , but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high .
rating:0 while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
rating:1 it's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive .
rating:0 the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
rating:0 would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility .
rating:0 a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .
rating:1 beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling . . . recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly .
rating:1 an imaginative comedy/thriller .
rating:0 i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them .
rating:1 gives you the steady pulse of life in a beautiful city viewed through the eyes of a character who , in spite of tragic loss and increasing decrepitude , knows in his bones that he is one of the luckiest men alive .
rating:0 if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .
rating:0 the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
rating:0 tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .
rating:0 there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters .
rating:0 there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant .
rating:1 a simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past .
rating:0 kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .

rating:1 poetry in motion captured on film . while it can be a bit repetitive , overall it's an entertaining and informative documentary .

rating:0 " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes .
rating:1 remember the kind of movie we were hoping " ecks vs . sever " or " xxx " was going to be ? this is it .
rating:1 heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on petter næss' delicate , clever direction . . . and a wonderful , imaginative script by axel hellstenius .
rating:1 a budget affair that exposes the generally sad existence of the bedouins while providing a precious twinkle of insight into their lives .
rating:1 like old myths and wonder tales spun afresh .

rating:1 essentially an exceptionally well-written , well-edited , well-directed , well-acted , bald rip-off of aliens .
rating:1 kaufman and jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing .
rating:1 a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps .
rating:1 the unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality .
rating:0 skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd .
rating:0 adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all .
rating:1 what's most memorable about circuit is that it's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large . . . and small . . . with considerable aplomb .
rating:0 tiresomely derivative and hammily acted .

rating:1 you won't believe much of it , but you will laugh at the audacity , at the who's who casting and the sheer insanity of it all .
rating:1 [chaiken's] talent lies in an evocative , accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively , convincing dialogue she creates for her characters .

rating:1 the wild thornberrys movie is a jolly surprise .
rating:0 at its best , it's black hawk down with more heart . at its worst , it's rambo- meets-john ford .

rating:0 it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun .
rating:1 the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons .
rating:0 despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .
rating:0 unfortunately , kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks " the four feathers " bare .
rating:0 when [reno] lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w . bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture .
rating:1 rare is the 'urban comedy' that even attempts the insight and honesty of this disarming indie .

rating:1 it's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit .

rating:1 this english-language version . . . does full honor to miyazaki's teeming and often unsettling landscape , and to the conflicted complexity of his characters .
rating:0 solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .
rating:1 it's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the american people to see what a candidate is like when he's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech .
rating:0 despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .
rating:1 a different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know .

rating:1 it is amusing , and that's all it needs to be .
rating:0 an intriguing near-miss .
rating:1 a rather brilliant little cult item : a pastiche of children's entertainment , superhero comics , and japanese animation .
rating:1 it's fairly self-aware in its dumbness .
rating:0 a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) .
rating:1 i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory .
rating:1 a conventional but heartwarming tale .
rating:0 once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .
rating:0 it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals .
rating:1 an overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful french coming-of-age film . . .
rating:0 enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons .
rating:0 the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay .
rating:0 the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run .
rating:0 kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities .
rating:1 brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , haneke's portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt .
rating:0 sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading .
rating:0 the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration .
rating:0 such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .
rating:1 stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation .
rating:0 believability wasn't one of the film's virtues .
rating:0 there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title .
rating:0 waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway .
rating:0 the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
rating:1 even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern .
rating:0 at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii .
rating:0 the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .
rating:0 proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .
rating:1 it's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds .
rating:0 the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .
rating:1 at once emotional and richly analytical , the cosby-seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose , larky documentary .
rating:1 it leaves little doubt that kidman has become one of our best actors .
rating:1 much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes .
rating:0 a movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'empowerment . '
rating:0 ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it .
rating:1 brings together some of the biggest names in japanese anime , with impressive results .
rating:1 for the most part , director anne-sophie birot's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama .
rating:0 in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .
rating:1 sure , it's more of the same , but as the film proves , that's not always a bad thing .
rating:1 that rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film .
rating:1 a captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners .
rating:0 a major waste . . . generic .
rating:1 the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes .
rating:1 few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness .
rating:1 it's [ricci's] best work yet , this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world's misery with blind good will .
rating:1 a loving little film of considerable appeal .
rating:0 unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
rating:0 men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . .
rating:1 the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth .
rating:1 vera has created a provocative , absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores .
rating:0 mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas .
rating:0 an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating .
rating:0 broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .
rating:0 the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
rating:1 this enthralling documentary . . . is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends .
rating:1 the more you think about the movie , the more you will probably like it .
rating:0 the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
rating:0 the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .
rating:1 what's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director's talent . watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers .
rating:1 by candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , [jones] calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity .
rating:1 a fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles .
rating:0 often silly – and gross – but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .
rating:0 each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
rating:0 the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc . -- to do the subject matter justice .
rating:0 it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .
rating:0 the plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story . but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold .
rating:1 the performances are an absolute joy .
rating:0 a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy .
rating:0 though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .
rating:0 'enigma' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable . a waste of good performances .
rating:1 like shrek , spirit's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world .
rating:0 verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .
rating:0 the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
rating:0 a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .
rating:1 the perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide .
rating:0 the film wasn't preachy , but it was feminism by the book .
rating:1 is truth stranger than fiction ? in [screenwriter] charlie kaufman's world , truth and fiction are equally strange , and his for the taking .
rating:1 from its invitingly upbeat overture to its pathos-filled but ultimately life-affirming finale , martin is a masterfully conducted work .
rating:1 thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun .
rating:0 . . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .
rating:1 ' . . . despite lagging near the finish line , the movie runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches . '
rating:1 guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook , rattled , or rolled .
rating:0 the film's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting .
rating:1 told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings .
rating:0 one of these days hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations .
rating:1 thanks to ice cube , benjamins feels an awful lot like friday in miami .
rating:1 satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity .
rating:0 enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid .
rating:0 from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out .
rating:1 tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme doesn't drag an audience down .
rating:0 offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life .
rating:1 a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking .
rating:0 too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up .
rating:0 the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything .
rating:0 works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .
rating:1 well-written , nicely acted and beautifully shot and scored , the film works on several levels , openly questioning social mores while ensnaring the audience with its emotional pull .
rating:0 a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads .
rating:0 the result is an 'action film' mired in stasis .
rating:0 first-time director joão pedro rodrigues' unwillingness to define his hero's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on .
rating:1 smart and taut .
rating:1 khouri manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum .
rating:1 spielberg's picture is smarter and subtler than [total recall and blade runner] , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences .
rating:0 [t]he ideas of revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
rating:0 this is a good movie in spurts , but when it doesn't work , it's at important times .
rating:0 a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .
rating:1 . . . a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice's second installment of her vampire chronicles .
rating:1 flawed but worthy look at life in u . s . relocation camps .
rating:1 occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going .
rating:1 a muckraking job , the cinematic equivalent of a legal indictment , and a fairly effective one at that .
rating:0 in a strange way , egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie .
rating:0 sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
rating:1 it excels because , unlike so many other hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope .
rating:0 a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .
rating:0 expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery .
rating:1 funny and touching .
rating:1 what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we've shared a great adventure .
rating:0 scene-by-scene , things happen , but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why .
rating:0 it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
rating:0 to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato .
rating:1 much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of don king , sonny miller , and michael stewart . their work is fantastic .
rating:0 the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix .
rating:1 i prefer soderbergh's concentration on his two lovers over tarkovsky's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies .
rating:0 everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way .
rating:0 does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?
rating:1 nothing is sacred in this gut-buster .
rating:0 nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .
rating:1 sex is one of those films that aims to confuse .
rating:1 after making several adaptations of other writers' work , armenian-canadian director atom egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject .
rating:0 better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .
rating:0 to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .
rating:0 first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people .
rating:1 mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun .
rating:0 an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original .
rating:1 romanek keeps the film constantly taut . . . reflecting the character's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score .
rating:0 a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust .
rating:1 if borstal boy isn't especially realistic , it is an engaging nostalgia piece .
rating:1 fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out .
rating:1 an impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent .
rating:1 payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey , featuring a pathetic , endearing hero who is all too human .
rating:1 the most brilliant and brutal uk crime film since jack carter went back to newcastle , the first half of gangster no . 1 drips with style and , at times , blood .
rating:0 black-and-white and unrealistic .
rating:1 the story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy .
rating:1 kept aloft largely by a comically adept ensemble .
rating:0 . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad .
rating:0 shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .
rating:1 the emperor's club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality .
rating:1 it's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb .
rating:0 it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .
rating:0 the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . 1 , but falls apart long before the end .
rating:0 in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it .
rating:1 keenly observed and refreshingly natural , swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s . c . , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner .
rating:0 shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .
rating:0 seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof .
rating:0 serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
rating:1 while i can't say it's on par with the first one , stuart little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie .
rating:1 provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust .
rating:1 fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way . . . that feels very human and very true to life .
rating:0 feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .
rating:1 gloriously goofy ( and gory ) midnight movie stuff .
rating:1 it's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements .
rating:1 best of all is garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man .
rating:0 the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power .
rating:1 admirers of director abel ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form .
rating:1 smith examines the intimate , unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes -- which pop up in nearly every corner of the country .
rating:0 [gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .
rating:1 a diverse and astonishingly articulate cast of palestinian and israeli children .
rating:0 the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .
rating:1 here's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep . but taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , the queen of the damned cannot be said to suck .
rating:0 it doesn't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .
rating:1 the first tunisian film i have ever seen , and it's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment i'm likely to see all year .
rating:0 although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .
rating:1 a quiet , pure , elliptical film
rating:1 now as a former gong show addict , i'll admit it , my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show .
rating:1 the first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it's actually watchable . even more baffling is that it's funny .
rating:1 achieves a sort of filmic epiphany that revels in the true potential of the medium .
rating:1 a sweet-tempered comedy that forgoes the knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies .
rating:0 depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it's being .
rating:0 disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances .
rating:1 while [roman coppola] scores points for style , he staggers in terms of story .
rating:0 [lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .
rating:1 the otherwise good-naturedness of mr . deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less- than-likely new york celebrities . . . certainly raises the film above anything sandler's been attached to before .
rating:1 . . . the implication is kissinger may have decided that — when it comes to truncheoning — it's better to give than to receive .
rating:0 ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ?
rating:1 cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark's dogma movement .
rating:0 just like hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .
rating:0 chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe .
rating:1 the script is smart , not cloying .
rating:0 a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men .
rating:1 the movie enters a realm where few non-porn films venture , and comes across as darkly funny , energetic , and surprisingly gentle .
rating:1 this is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio's absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed .
rating:1 as if trying to grab a lump of play-doh , the harder that liman tries to squeeze his story , the more details slip out between his fingers .
rating:0 it's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner .
rating:0 trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the " gadzooks ! "
rating:1 prancing his way through the tailor-made part of a male hooker approaching the end of his vitality , jagger obviously relishes every self-mocking moment .
rating:0 chao was chen kaige's assistant for years in china . he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .
rating:0 cinematic poo .
rating:1 the story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that's rare in film today , but be warned : it's a slow slog to get there .
rating:1 frida's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it's among the most breathtakingly designed films i've ever seen .
rating:0 i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .
rating:0 you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing .
rating:1 despite a quieter middle section , involving aragorn's dreams of arwen , this is even better than the fellowship . there are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away .
rating:0 let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears .
rating:0 despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .
rating:1 [drumline] is entertaining for what it does , and admirable for what it doesn't do .
rating:1 it's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and i think that's what i liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline .
rating:1 byler is too savvy a filmmaker to let this morph into a typical romantic triangle . instead , he focuses on the anguish that can develop when one mulls leaving the familiar to traverse uncharted ground .
rating:0 though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear .
rating:0 a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy .
rating:1 the film's only missteps come from the script's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale's antics .
rating:0 for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets [sci-fi] rehash .
rating:0 an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s .
rating:1 . . . does such a fine job of engulfing you in its world and allying you with its characters' choices , good and ill , that its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought .
rating:1 confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from king hunk .
rating:0 the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .
rating:1 the biggest problem with this movie is that it's not nearly long enough .
rating:0 has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act .
rating:0 the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .
rating:0 decent but dull .
rating:1 what i saw , i enjoyed .
rating:1 light , cute and forgettable .
rating:1 it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story .
rating:0 the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next .
rating:0 the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace .
rating:1 that storytelling has value cannot be denied . not even solondz's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it .
rating:0 lurid and less than lucid work .
rating:1 the year's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way .
rating:1 we can see the wheels turning , and we might resent it sometimes , but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer .
rating:0 a film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy .
rating:1 [grant's] bumbling magic takes over the film , and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle .
rating:1 take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema .
rating:1 it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i can't wait for the sequel .
rating:1 all in all , an interesting look at the life of the campaign-trail press , especially ones that don't really care for the candidate they're forced to follow .
rating:0 feels like a cold old man going through the motions .
rating:1 though the plot is predictable , the movie never feels formulaic , because the attention is on the nuances of the emotional development of the delicate characters .
rating:0 wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .
rating:1 it's a count for our times .
rating:0 it's better than mid-range steven seagal , but not as sharp as jet li on rollerblades .
rating:1 the charm of revolution os is rather the way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers .
rating:0 since lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random e ! true hollywood story .
rating:1 rubbo's humorously tendentious intervention into the who-wrote-shakespeare controversy .
rating:0 mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money .
rating:1 brian tufano's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special .
rating:1 despite its old-hat set-up and predictable plot , empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining .
rating:0 anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly .
rating:0 one suspects that craven endorses they simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison .
rating:1 whether or not you're enlightened by any of derrida's lectures on " the other " and " the self , " derrida is an undeniably fascinating and playful fellow .
rating:0 apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess .
rating:1 a tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty .
rating:0 new ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is .
rating:1 the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for gai's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her .
rating:1 where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment .
rating:0 [seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels .
rating:0 the people in abc africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras .
rating:1 fulford-wierzbicki . . . deftly captures the wise-beyond-her-years teen .
rating:1 os universos de chuck barris e charlie kaufman são complementares . e igualmente fascinantes .
rating:1 humorous , artsy , and even cute , in an off-kilter , dark , vaguely disturbing way .
rating:0 ultimately . . . the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults .
rating:0 not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .
rating:1 a must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle .
rating:0 the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad .

rating:1 a very well-made , funny and entertaining picture .
rating:1 an artful , intelligent film that stays within the confines of a well-established genre .
rating:0 unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself .
rating:0 a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special .
rating:1 bubba ho-tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by bruce campbell that doesn't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it .
rating:1 the real triumphs in igby come from philippe , who makes oliver far more interesting than the character's lines would suggest , and sarandon , who couldn't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron .
rating:1 caviezel embodies the transformation of his character completely .
rating:0 at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave .
rating:0 while howard's appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .
rating:1 the film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once . the extent to which it succeeds is impressive .
rating:1 there's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking .
rating:0 has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital .
rating:1 there's so much to look at in metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles .
rating:1 be prepared to cling to the edge of your seat , tense with suspense . the ring never lets you off the hook .
rating:1 'a fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . '
rating:0 it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction .

rating:1 a sharp satire of desperation and cinematic deception .
rating:0 viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who's who in this pretentious mess .
rating:1 an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson .
rating:0 given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is .
rating:0 pascale bailly's rom-com provides amélie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i . e . , a banal spiritual quest .
rating:0 any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .
rating:1 surprisingly insightful
rating:1 jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he's easy to like and always leaves us laughing .
rating:1 holm . . . embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma .
rating:0 everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel .
rating:1 cool ? this movie is a snow emergency .
rating:0 been there done that .
rating:0 it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet .
rating:1 mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances . . . and excellent use of music by india's popular gulzar and jagjit singh .
rating:1 a grittily beautiful film that looks , sounds , and feels more like an extended , open-ended poem than a traditionally structured story .
rating:0 . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers .
rating:0 go , girls , right down the reality drain .
rating:0 writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic .
rating:1 " the turntable is now outselling the electric guitar . . . "
rating:1 a quiet , disquieting triumph .
rating:1 with three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it's enough to make you wish jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective .
rating:1 . . . a solid , well-formed satire .
rating:1 like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike . a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series .
rating:0 a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .
rating:1 directing with a sure and measured hand , [haneke] steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology .
rating:0 stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition – wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text – when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .
rating:1 garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work .
rating:0 while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey .
rating:0 a full-frontal attack on audience patience .
rating:1 without [de niro] , city by the sea would slip under the waves . he drags it back , single-handed .
rating:0 an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode .
rating:0 if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .
rating:1 it's a great american adventure and a wonderful film to bring to imax .
rating:0 when the first few villians are introduced as " spider " and " snake " you know you're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak .
rating:0 completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque .

rating:1 4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it's the ultimate redneck road-trip .
rating:1 it looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships .
rating:1 this submarine drama earns the right to be favorably compared to das boot .
rating:0 bluto blutarsky , we miss you .
rating:1 about the best thing you could say about narc is that it's a rock-solid little genre picture . whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste .
rating:0 claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .
rating:1 an enjoyable experience .
rating:1 a fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to betty fisher and left out the other stories .
rating:0 the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast .
rating:0 bad in such a bizarre way that it's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste .
rating:1 goofy , nutty , consistently funny . and educational !
rating:0 in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little .
rating:0 it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison .
rating:0 is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me .
rating:0 this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .
rating:0 instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized .
rating:1 it's up to [watts] to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe .
rating:1 it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) , but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year .
rating:0 hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast .
rating:1 an instance of an old dog not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick .
rating:1 combines sharp comedy , old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics , and genuine heart to create a film that's not merely about kicking undead * * * , but also about dealing with regret and , ultimately , finding redemption .
rating:1 a captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age .
rating:0 abysmally pathetic
rating:1 though lan yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency , the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude .
rating:0 there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups .
rating:1 the people in jessica are so recognizable and true that , as in real life , we're never sure how things will work out .
rating:1 the simplicity of the way home has few equals this side of aesop
rating:1 the filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers .
rating:0 bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it . it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate . i admit it , i hate to like it .
rating:0 this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks .
rating:0 the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short .
rating:0 the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .
rating:0 the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .
rating:0 not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .
rating:1 in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation .
rating:1 even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it's documenting .
rating:1 norton holds the film together .
rating:1 solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike .
rating:1 simple , poignant and leavened with humor , it's a film that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship .
rating:0 it's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .
rating:0 the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine .
rating:0 the re- enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well .
rating:1 a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling--but unquestionably alive .
rating:0 wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own .
rating:1 a surprisingly sweet and gentle comedy .
rating:0 terminally brain dead production .
rating:0 ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue .
rating:0 to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable .
rating:0 the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .
rating:0 it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
rating:0 however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release .
rating:1 miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images .
rating:1 it's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make just a kiss seem minty fresh .
rating:0 screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster .
rating:0 for dance completists only .
rating:0 a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive .
rating:1 what sets this romantic comedy apart from most hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material .
rating:0 looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights .
rating:1 it's an ambitious film , and as with all ambitious films , it has some problems . but on the whole , you're gonna like this movie .
rating:1 much monkeyfun for all .
rating:0 the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .
rating:1 stephen rea , aidan quinn , and alan bates play desmond's legal eagles , and when joined by brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , 'tis .
rating:0 i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama .
rating:1 bourne , jason bourne . he can scale a building like a super hero , he can out-stealth any agent , he'll get the girl . he's super spy !
rating:0 a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to .
rating:1 at a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had , godfrey reggio's career shines like a lonely beacon .
rating:1 poignant and funny .
rating:1 if we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like tim mccann's revolution no . 9 .
rating:1 it will not appeal to the impatient , but those who like long books and movies will admire the way it accumulates power and depth .
rating:1 those with an interest in new or singular sorts of film experiences will find what time is it there ? well worth the time .
rating:1 an engaging overview of johnson's eccentric career .
rating:0 ' . . . the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well . . . but quite frankly , scoob and shag don't eat enough during the film . '
rating:1 anchored by a terrific performance by abbass , satin rouge shows that the idea of women's self-actualization knows few continental divides .
rating:0 [javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama .
rating:1 sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film .
rating:1 . . . very funny , very enjoyable . . .
rating:0 this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids . parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
rating:0 there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter .
rating:1 you don't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate scratch , and that's the mark of a documentary that works .
rating:1 we need [moore's] noisy , cocky energy , his passion and class consciousness ; we need his shticks , we need his stones .
rating:1 the film has a kind of hard , cold effect .
rating:1 a remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic .
rating:0 credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment .
rating:0 essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty .
rating:1 the artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache .
rating:1 makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the kurdish refugees of iran's borderlands .
rating:1 bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake .
rating:0 has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release .
rating:0 feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work .
rating:1 director rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one .
rating:0 summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this .
rating:0 so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic .
rating:1 the farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one .
rating:0 the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film .
rating:0 it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
rating:0 the worst film of the year .
rating:1 it works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory .
rating:0 i hated every minute of it .
rating:0 its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy .
rating:1 isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol's most intense psychological mysteries .
rating:1 the cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story .
rating:1 k-19 : the widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining .
rating:0 even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test .
rating:0 the problem with all of this : it's not really funny .
rating:0 " men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?
rating:1 the philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable .
rating:1 there's a lot to recommend read my lips .
rating:1 much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be .
rating:1 a gangster movie with the capacity to surprise .
rating:0 `hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere .
rating:0 we could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product .
rating:1 the movie is a trove of delights .
rating:0 i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long .
rating:1 birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .
rating:0 girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy .
rating:1 the scorpion king is more fun than conan the barbarian .
rating:1 this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever .
rating:1 this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you'll be glad you went along for the ride .
rating:0 while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .
rating:1 measured against practically any like-themed film other than its oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor the silence of the lambs , red dragon rates as an exceptional thriller .
rating:0 you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story .
rating:1 if you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you .
rating:0 the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
rating:0 the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .
rating:0 an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging .
rating:0 ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
rating:0 earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
rating:0 director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times .
rating:1 knows how to make our imagination wonder .
rating:1 it's not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered .
rating:1 an infectious cultural fable with a tasty balance of family drama and frenetic comedy .
rating:0 automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .
rating:1 this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it's hard to know what to praise first .
rating:0 another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .
rating:1 a real audience-pleaser that will strike a chord with anyone who's ever waited in a doctor's office , emergency room , hospital bed or insurance company office .
rating:0 an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .
rating:1 what it lacks in substance it makes up for in heart .
rating:1 i know i shouldn't have laughed , but hey , those farts got to my inner nine-year-old .
rating:0 when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
rating:0 it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned .
rating:1 showtime is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation .
rating:0 unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg .
rating:1 chaiken ably balances real-time rhythms with propulsive incident .
rating:0 was i scared ? only at the prospect of beck's next project . let's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what's next . . . ghost blimp ?
rating:1 reggio's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking .
rating:1 ( danny huston gives ) an astounding performance that deftly , gradually reveals a real human soul buried beneath a spellbinding serpent's smirk .
rating:1 holm does his sly , intricate magic , and iben hjelje is entirely appealing as pumpkin .
rating:1 cho continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio .
rating:0 there's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself .
rating:0 if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .
rating:0 the town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .
rating:1 the continued good chemistry between carmen and juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained .
rating:0 it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy .
rating:1 as banal as the telling may be -- and at times , all my loved ones more than flirts with kitsch -- the tale commands attention .
rating:0 it's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .
rating:0 friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite .
rating:1 a psychological thriller with a genuinely spooky premise and an above-average cast , actor bill paxton's directing debut is a creepy slice of gothic rural americana .
rating:1 the enjoyable undercover brother , a zany mix of saturday night live-style parody , '70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy .
rating:1 the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure .
rating:1 an appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles .
rating:0 the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' .
rating:0 a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect .
rating:0 murder by numbers just doesn't add up .
rating:1 what makes this film special is serry's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context .
rating:1 a glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism .
rating:0 imagine ( if possible ) a pasolini film without passion or politics , or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching o fantasma .
rating:1 high crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it can't help but engage an audience .
rating:1 a funny film .
rating:1 a masterful film from a master filmmaker , unique in its deceptive grimness , compelling in its fatalist worldview .
rating:0 the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .
rating:0 an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .
rating:0 don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action .
rating:0 . . . unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted .
rating:0 such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production .
rating:0 hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing .
rating:1 a subject like this should inspire reaction in its audience ; the pianist does not .
