rating:1 you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy's holes , and the scripters don't deserve any oscars . but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment .
rating:1 nair doesn't treat the issues lightly . she allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly .
rating:1 lead actress gaï , she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile , is a towering siren .
rating:0 sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .
rating:0 it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .
rating:0 feeble comedy .
rating:0 with the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better .
rating:0 a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad .
rating:1 both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter .
rating:0 directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .
rating:1 light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time .
rating:1 though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous . it's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history .
rating:1 judith and zaza's extended bedroom sequence . . . is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics .
rating:1 a zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans ( but by no means all ) will have fun with .
rating:0 it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .
rating:0 if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .
rating:0 if you adored the full monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained .
rating:1 roman coppola may never become the filmmaker his dad was , but heck – few filmmakers will . but based on cq , i'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project .
rating:1 birthday girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked .
rating:0 the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .
rating:1 the script's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off .
rating:1 bravo for history rewritten , and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love .
rating:1 claude miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications .
rating:0 it's fitfully funny but never really takes off .
rating:0 it's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense .
rating:0 an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
rating:1 below may not mark mr . twohy's emergence into the mainstream , but his promise remains undiminished .
rating:0 zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .
rating:0 howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective .
rating:0 you can see where big bad love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there .
rating:0 a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours . . . a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle .
rating:1 [kline's] utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who can't quite live up to it .
rating:0 a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .
rating:0 one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in .
rating:1 the actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way .
rating:1 great fun both for sports aficionados and for ordinary louts whose idea of exercise is climbing the steps of a stadium-seat megaplex .
rating:1 if the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , jacquot preserves tosca's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera .
rating:0 unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny .
rating:0 a ragbag of cliches .
rating:0 rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf's encounter with the world .
rating:1 over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that's got oodles of style and substance .
rating:1 it would be disingenuous to call reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex . this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn .
rating:0 it's just rather leaden and dull .
rating:0 what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .
rating:1 the film will appeal to discovery channel fans and will surely widen the perspective of those of us who see the continent through rose-colored glasses .
rating:1 a witty , trenchant , wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking .
rating:0 city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery .
rating:1 the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties .
rating:1 it all adds up to good fun .
rating:0 . . . too sappy for its own good .
rating:1 . . . wise and elegiac . . .
rating:1 this one is strictly a lightweight escapist film .
rating:0 the concept behind kung pow : enter the fist is hilarious . it's too bad nothing else is .
rating:0 a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale .
rating:1 how good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not .
rating:1 the recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom .
rating:1 chris columbus' sequel is faster , livelier and a good deal funnier than his original .
rating:0 cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them .
rating:1 you'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama .
rating:0 the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .
rating:1 attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage .
rating:0 so earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script .
rating:0 to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough .
rating:0 freundlich's made [crudup] a suburban architect , and a cipher .
rating:1 what doesn't this film have that an impressionable kid couldn't stand to hear ?
rating:0 clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up .
rating:1 what's not to like about a movie with a 'children's' song that includes the line 'my stepdad's not mean , he's just adjusting' ?
rating:1 filmmakers dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann area headed east , far east , in retelling a historically significant , and personal , episode detailing how one international city welcomed tens of thousands of german jewish refugees while the world's democracie
rating:0 'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach .
rating:0 i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere .
rating:0 too much of the humor falls flat .
rating:0 a lifetime movie about men .
rating:0 lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned .
rating:0 taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise .
rating:0 'god help us , but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
rating:1 pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical .
rating:1 dark and unrepentant , this excursion into the epicenter of percolating mental instability is not easily dismissed or forgotten .
rating:0 it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
rating:1 you don't know whether to admire the film's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace . or both .
rating:1 you won't look at religious fanatics -- or backyard sheds -- the same way again .
rating:1 ford deserves to be remembered at oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier .
rating:1 a movie that will thrill you , touch you and make you laugh as well .
rating:1 this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment .
rating:0 you can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer . thumbs down .
rating:0 as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up .
rating:0 " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment – until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
rating:0 too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets .
rating:0 seems like someone going through the motions .
rating:1 the best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence .
rating:1 go see it and enjoy .
rating:1 . . . if you're in a mind set for goofy comedy , the troopers will entertain with their gross outs , bawdy comedy and head games .
rating:0 with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .
rating:0 the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .
rating:0 any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .
rating:0 clare peploe's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence .
rating:0 the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .
rating:1 a thoughtful look at a painful incident that made headlines in 1995 .
rating:0 just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny .

rating:0 friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it's called where's chris tucker when you need him ?
rating:0 boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome .
rating:1 the directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge
rating:0 while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .
rating:0 between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap .
rating:0 we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas .
rating:0 these characters become wearisome .
rating:0 the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .
rating:1 a live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze .
rating:1 great performances , stylish cinematography and a gritty feel help make gangster no . 1 a worthwhile moviegoing experience .
rating:0 a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics .
rating:0 . . . a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off .
rating:0 i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
rating:0 holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .
rating:0 authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow .
rating:1 while obviously aimed at kids , the country bears . . . should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio .
rating:1 . . . an inviting piece of film .
rating:1 quietly engaging .
rating:1 a mature , deeply felt fantasy of a director's travel through 300 years of russian history .
rating:0 what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead .
rating:0 perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about .
rating:0 it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .
rating:0 i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .
rating:1 though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors .
rating:1 steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it's so clever you want to hate it . but he somehow pulls it off .
rating:1 a b-movie you can sit through , enjoy on a certain level and then forget .
rating:0 scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick .
rating:1 this new movie version of the alexandre dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit .
rating:0 'abandon all hope , ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide .
rating:0 as steamy as last week's pork dumplings .
rating:0 the most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill .
rating:1 a three-hour cinema master class .
rating:1 a delightful stimulus for the optic nerves , so much that it's forgivable that the plot feels like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow .
rating:0 . . . unbearably lame .
rating:0 everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television .
rating:0 calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls .
rating:1 while guzmán frustratingly refuses to give pinochet's crimes a political context , his distance from the material is mostly admirable .
rating:1 star wars is back in a major way .
rating:0 an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .
rating:1 while this gentle and affecting melodrama will have luvvies in raptures , it's far too slight and introspective to appeal to anything wider than a niche audience .
rating:0 the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls .
rating:0 the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
rating:1 i know that i'll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again
rating:1 en sí mismo el rey león es un espectáculo digno de contemplarse en cine , dvd o en su soberbio montaje teatral ; pero el hacerlo en la pantalla imax es una experiencia colosal .
rating:1 manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas .
rating:1 we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies .
rating:0 [t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context .
rating:0 ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout — and meat loaf explodes .
rating:0 the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness .
rating:1 much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words don't really do the era justice . you have to see it .
rating:1 if you're content with a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director's life , eisenstein delivers .
rating:1 the son of the bride's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also isn't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues . this movie is to be cherished .
rating:0 hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture .
rating:1 funny , sexy , devastating and incurably romantic .
rating:1 a blessed gift to film geeks and historians . if the '70's were your idea of a good time at the movies , this will make you very happy .
rating:0 super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers .
rating:1 highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role .
rating:1 just watch bettany strut his stuff . you'll know a star when you see one .
rating:0 a serious movie with serious ideas . but seriously , folks , it doesn't work .
rating:0 it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : " got aids yet ? "
rating:1 features fincher's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity .
rating:1 the film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol .
rating:0 when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs . woo , it looks like woo's a p . o . w .
rating:1 what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point .
rating:0 the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it's at least watchable .
rating:0 the threat implied in the title pokémon 4ever is terrifying – like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .
rating:1 like a tarantino movie with heart , alias betty is richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing .
rating:1 a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe .
rating:0 absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying .
rating:0 the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though .
rating:1 isn't quite the equal of woo's best earlier work , but it's easily his finest american film . . . comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his hong kong films .
rating:0 the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .
rating:0 attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither .
rating:0 it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .
rating:0 criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama .
rating:0 i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem .
rating:1 it's immensely ambitious , different than anything that's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it's trying to do .
rating:0 a porn film without the sex scenes .
rating:0 this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story .
rating:0 was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?
rating:1 notorious c . h . o . has oodles of vulgar highlights .
rating:1 it's a glorious spectacle like those d . w . griffith made in the early days of silent film .
rating:1 it thankfully goes easy on the reel/real world dichotomy that [jaglom] pursued with such enervating determination in venice/venice .
rating:0 the characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects .
rating:1 director andrew niccol . . . demonstrates a wry understanding of the quirks of fame . his healthy sense of satire is light and fun . . . .
rating:0 queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame .
rating:1 witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy .
rating:1 it's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our hollywood has all but lost .
rating:0 an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom . . . you'd be wise to send your regrets .
rating:1 marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary .
rating:1 a terrifically entertaining specimen of spielbergian sci-fi .
rating:1 if it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life's urgent questions .
rating:0 too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
rating:1 despite besson's high-profile name being wasabi's big selling point , there is no doubt that krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film's thoroughly winning tone .
rating:0 a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda .
rating:1 cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing .
rating:0 alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors .
rating:1 here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix .
rating:0 simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say .
rating:0 with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike .
rating:0 wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award .
rating:1 a properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not .
rating:1 a lovably old-school hollywood confection .
rating:1 uneven , self-conscious but often hilarious spoof .
rating:1 about schmidt is nicholson's goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing king lear .
rating:0 each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .
rating:0 a great idea becomes a not-great movie .
rating:1 . . . myers has turned his franchise into the movie version of an adolescent dirty-joke book done up in post-tarantino pop-culture riffs . . .
rating:0 i haven't seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered .
rating:0 so few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler .
rating:1 compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder .
rating:1 at its best , the good girl is a refreshingly adult take on adultery . . .
rating:0 while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
rating:0 without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos .
rating:1 even the digressions are funny .
rating:1 this is one of mr . chabrol's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny .
rating:1 one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals . . . a psychological masterpiece .
rating:1 a playful iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences .
rating:0 full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .
rating:0 more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .
rating:1 director claude chabrol has become the master of innuendo . it is not what you see , it is what you think you see .
rating:1 an admirable , sometimes exceptional film
rating:1 an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama .
rating:1 a deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect .
rating:0 in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
rating:1 one of the best , most understated performances of [jack nicholson's] career .
rating:0 a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater .
rating:1 the movie is ingenious fun . see it .
rating:0 . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor .
rating:1 adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of orlean's themes without being a true adaptation of her book .
rating:1 it is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some . i haven't seen one in so long , no wonder i didn't recognize it at first .
rating:1 there is truth here
rating:0 kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .
rating:0 too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .
rating:0 though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .
rating:0 . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie .
rating:0 the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear .
rating:1 a woman's pic directed with resonance by ilya chaiken .
rating:1 . . . [the film] works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay .
rating:1 i admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent's complaint .
rating:1 if director michael dowse only superficially understands his characters , he doesn't hold them in contempt .
rating:1 a thriller made from a completist's checklist rather than with a cultist's passion .
rating:1 the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d .
rating:1 a uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot .
rating:1 like an episode of mtv's undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance . . . indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper .
rating:0 a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family .
rating:1 frailty isn't as gory or explicit . but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing .
rating:0 schneidermeister . . . makin' a fool of himself . . . losin' his fan base . . .
rating:0 lame , haphazard teen comedy .
rating:1 perhaps the grossest movie ever made . funny , though .
rating:1 hollywood ending is not show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty nonetheless .
rating:0 this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through .
rating:0 miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .
rating:0 watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen .
rating:0 drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness .
rating:1 an old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts .
rating:1 a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic , the work of a genuine and singular artist .
rating:1 deliberately and skillfully uses ambiguity to suggest possibilities which imbue the theme with added depth and resonance .
rating:0 time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .
rating:0 the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .
rating:0 the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
rating:1 an absorbing , slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true .
rating:0 there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .
rating:1 . . . best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the warren report .
rating:0 … is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . i had to look away - this was god awful .
rating:1 what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity .
rating:1 the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past .
rating:0 did we really need a remake of " charade ? "
rating:0 the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
rating:1 a comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising .
rating:0 if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films .
rating:0 i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin' down .
rating:1 the solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre .
rating:0 eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema's directorial giants .
rating:0 the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .
rating:1 dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments .
rating:0 like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again .
rating:0 too clever by about nine-tenths .
rating:0 coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else .
rating:1 the engagingly primitive animated special effects contribute to a mood that's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion .
rating:0 supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . alas , getting there is not even half the interest .
rating:1 a movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship lil' bow wow .
rating:1 as a film director , labute continues to improve .
rating:0 there's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career .

rating:0 very well made , but doesn't generate a lot of tension .
rating:1 i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible .
rating:0 it's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable .
rating:1 a beguiling , slow-moving parable about the collision of past and present on a remote seacoast in iran .

rating:1 challenging , intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative . but it's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle .
rating:1 broomfield has a rather unique approach to documentary . he thinks the film is just as much a document about him as it is about the subject .
rating:0 one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating .
rating:1 escaping the studio , piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie .
rating:1 it's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful .
rating:0 despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .
rating:1 . . . takes the beauty of baseball and melds it with a story that could touch anyone regardless of their familiarity with the sport
rating:0 no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through .
rating:1 a straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they've rarely been given .
rating:0 the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile .

rating:1 bow's best moments are when he's getting busy on the basketball court because that's when he really scores .
rating:1 a virtual roller-coaster ride of glamour and sleaze .

rating:0 not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed .

rating:0 the action clichés just pile up .
rating:0 as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing .

rating:0 the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .

rating:1 life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why .
rating:0 according to wendigo , 'nature' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves .
rating:0 despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny . '
rating:0 trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens .

rating:1 chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of 'ethnic cleansing . '
rating:0 while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier .
rating:0 too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .

rating:0 what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .
rating:1 purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u . s . foreign policy has played in the rise of castro .
rating:0 historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
rating:1 a thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty .
rating:1 there's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like the bourne identity that's packed with just as much intelligence as action .

rating:1 even if you can't pronounce " gyro " correctly , you'll appreciate much of vardalos' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries .
rating:0 starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner .
rating:0 purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .
rating:1 definitely funny stuff , but it's more of the 'laughing at' variety than the 'laughing with . '

rating:1 take care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length .

rating:0 though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted .
rating:0 while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde's wit and the actors' performances .

rating:1 the two leads , nearly perfect in their roles , bring a heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie .

rating:1 the movie plays up the cartoon's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength .

rating:0 a chiller resolutely without chills .
